all to jesus i surrender
all to him i freely give
i will ever love and trust him
in his presence daily live

    i surrender all
    i surrender all
    all to thee my blessed saviour
    i surrender all

all to jesus i surrender
humbly at his feet i bow
worldly pleasures all forsaken
take me jesus take me now

all to jesus i surrender
lord i give myself to thee
fill me with thy love and power
let thy blessing fall on me

all to jesus i surrender
now i feel the sacred flame
o the joy of full salvation
glory glory to his name
