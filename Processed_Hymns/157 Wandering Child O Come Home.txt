have you wandered away from your fathers care
heavy hearted and sad do you roam
theres a sweet gentle voice calling now to you
wandring child wandring child o come home

    child come home child come home
    wandring child why longer roam
    tis thy father entreats
    wandring child o come home

is your frail bark adrift on lifes raging sea
are you tossed on its billows and foam
theres a safe harbor home waiting now for you
wandring child wandring child o come home 

he is pleading today heed his gentle voice
as he bids you no longer to roam
to that dear fathers house haste without delay
wandring child wandring child o come home
