to god be the glory great things he hath done
so loved he the world that he gave us his son
who yielded his life an atonement for sin
and opened the life gate that all may go in

    praise the lord praise the lord
    let the earth hear his voice
    praise the lord praise the lord
    let the people rejoice
    oh come to the father through jesus the son
    and give him the glory great things he hath done

o perfect redemption the purchase of blood
to evry believer the promise of god
the vilest offender who truly believes
that moment from jesus a pardon receives

great things he hath taught us great things he hath done
and great our rejoicing through jesus the son
but purer and higher and greater will be
our wonder our transport when jesus we see
