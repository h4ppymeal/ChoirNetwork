when i come to the river at the ending of day
when the last winds of sorrow have blown
there will be somebody waiting to show me the way
i will not have to cross jordan alone

    i will not have to cross jordan alone
    jesus died all my sins to atone
    in the darkness i see
    he will be waiting for me
    i will not have to cross jordan alone

often times i am weary and troubled and sad
when it seems that my friends have all flown
there is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad
i will not have to cross jordan alone

i will not have to cross jordan alone
jesus died all my sins to atone
in the darkness i see
he will be waiting for me
i will not have to cross jordan alone

though the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep
christ the savior will care for his own
till the end of my journey my soul he will keep
and i will not have to cross jordan alone

i will not have to cross jordan alone
jesus died all my sins to atone
in the darkness i see
he will be waiting for me
i will not have to cross jordan alone
