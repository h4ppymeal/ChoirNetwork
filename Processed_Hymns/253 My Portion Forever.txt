all all to jesus i consecrate anew
he is my portion forever
only his glory henceforth will i pursue
he is my portion forever

    take take the world with all its gilded toys
    take take the world i covet not its joys
    mine is a wealth no moth nor rust destroys
    he is my portion forever

all all to jesus my trusting heart can say
he is my portion forever
led by his mercy im walking evry day
he is my portion forever

though he may try me this blessed truth i know
he is my portion forever
he will not leave me his promise tells me so
he is my portion forever

all all to jesus i cheerfully resign
he is my portion forever
i have the witness that he my lord is mine
he is my portion forever
