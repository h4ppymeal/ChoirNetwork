i dont know about tomorrow
i just live from day to day
i dont borrow from its sunshine
for its skies may turn to gray
i dont worry oer the future
for i know what jesus said
and today ill walk beside him
for he knows what is ahead

    many things about tomorrow
    i dont seem to understand
    but i know who holds tomorrow
    and i know who holds my hand

evry step is getting brighter
as the golden stairs i climb
evry burdens getting lighter
evry cloud is silver lined
there the sun is always shining
there no tear will dim the eyes
at the ending of the rainbow
where the mountains touch the sky

i dont know about tomorrow
it may bring me poverty
but the one who feeds the sparrow
is the one who stands by me
and the path that be my portion
may be through the flame or flood
but his presence goes before me
and im covered with his blood
