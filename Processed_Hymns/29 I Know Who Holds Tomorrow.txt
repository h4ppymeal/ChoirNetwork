i do not know about tomorrow
i just live from day to day
i do not borrow from its sunshine
for its skies may turn to gray
i do not worry over the future
for i know what jesus said
and today i will walk beside him
for he knows what is ahead

    many things about tomorrow
    i do not seem to understand
    but i know who holds tomorrow
    and i know who holds my hand

ev'ry step is getting brighter
as the golden stairs i climb
ev'ry burden's getting lighter
ev'ry cloud is silver lined
there the sun is always shining
there no tear will dim the eyes
at the ending of the rainbow
where the mountains touch the sky

i do not know about tomorrow
it may bring me poverty
but the one who feeds the sparrow
is the one who stands by me
and the path that be my portion
may be through the flame or flood
but his presence goes before me
and i am covered with his blood
