i was sinking deep in sin
far from the peaceful shore
very deeply stained within
sinking to rise no more
but the master of the sea
heard my despairing cry
from the waters lifted me
now safe am i 

    love lifted me love lifted me 
    when nothing else could help
    love lifted me
    love lifted me love lifted me 
    when nothing else could help
    love lifted me

all my heart to him i give
ever to him i will cling in his presence live
ever his praises sing
love so mighty and so true 
merits my soul's best songs 
faithful loving service too
to him belongs

souls in danger look above
jesus completely saves
he will lift you by his love
out of the angry waves
he is the master of the sea
billows his will obey
he your savior wants to be 
be saved today refrain
