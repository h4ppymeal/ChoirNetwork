friends all around me are trying to find
what the heart yearns for by sin undermined
i have the secret i know where tis found
only true pleasures in jesus abound

    all that i want is in jesus
    he satisfies joy he supplies
    life would be worthless without him
    all things in jesus i find

some carry burdens whose weight has for years
crushed them with sorrow and blinded with tears
yet one stands ready to help them just now
if they will humbly in penitence bow

no other name thrills the joy chords within
and through none else is remission of sin
he knows the pain of the heart sorely tried
both need and want will by him be supplied

jesus is all this poor world needs today
blindly they strive for sin darkens their way
o to draw back the grim curtains of night
one glimpse of jesus and all will be bright
