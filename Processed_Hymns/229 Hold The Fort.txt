ho my comrades see the signal
waving in the sky
reinforcements now appearing
victory is nigh

    hold the fort for i am coming
    jesus signals still
    wave the answer back to heaven
    by thy grace we will

see the mighty host advancing
satan leading on
mighty men around us falling
courage almost gone

see the glorious banner waving
hear the trumpet blow
in our leader's name we will triumph
over every foe

fierce and long the battle rages
but our help is near
onward comes our great commander
cheer my comrades cheer
