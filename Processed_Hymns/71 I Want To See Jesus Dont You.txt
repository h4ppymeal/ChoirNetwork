there is one loved me so that for me he died
he’s my dear precious savior so true
on the cross for my sins he was crucified
i want to see jesus don’t you

    i want to see jesus don’t you
    my savior so faithful and true
    when i reach the strand of that lovebright land
    o i want to see jesus don’t you

when i’m weary and faint he is always near
with his joy he my strength doth renew
and he comforts my heart speaking words of cheer
i want to see jesus don’t you 

holy angels keep watch o’er me through the night
and each morning he guards me anew
in the smile of his love doth my soul delight
i want to see jesus don’t you

he is fairer than lily or rose to me
and his blessings fall soft as the dew
o my heart how it longs his dear face to see
i want to see jesus don’t you 

there’s a place for my soul that he doth prepare
and its beauty by faith i can view
first of all when i enter that mansion fair
i want to see jesus don’t you
