there is one loved me so that for me he died
he is my dear precious savior so true
on the cross for my sins he was crucified
i want to see jesus do not you

    i want to see jesus do not you
    my savior so faithful and true
    when i reach the strand of that lovebright land
    o i want to see jesus do not you

when i am weary and faint he is always near
with his joy he my strength doth renew
and he comforts my heart speaking words of cheer
i want to see jesus do not you 

holy angels keep watch over me through the night
and each morning he guards me anew
in the smile of his love doth my soul delight
i want to see jesus do not you

he is fairer than lily or rose to me
and his blessings fall soft as the dew
o my heart how it longs his dear face to see
i want to see jesus do not you 

there is a place for my soul that he doth prepare
and its beauty by faith i can view
first of all when i enter that mansion fair
i want to see jesus do not you
