wonderful love that rescued me 
sunk deep in sin
guilty and vile as i could be
no hope within
when evry ray of light had fled 
o glorious day
raising my soul from out the dead 
love found a way

    love found a way to redeem my soul
    love found a way that could make me whole
    love sent my lord to the cross of shame
    love found a way o praise his holy name

love brot my saviour here to die 
on calvary
for such a sinful wretch as i
how can it be
love bridged the gulf twixt me and heavn 
taught me to pray
i am redeemed set free forgivn
love found a way 

love opened wide the gates of light 
to heavns domain
where in eternal powr and might 
jesus shall reign
love lifted me from depths of woe 
to endless day
there was no help in earth below
love found a way
