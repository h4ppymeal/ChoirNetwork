when first the risen lord of pow'r
his chosen ones sent forth
a charge he gave that solemn hour
to preach his saving worth
go ye said he to all mankind
declare my word and ye shall find
these signs shall surely follow them
who on my name believe

no demons shall before them stand
no poison do them harm
nor subtle serpent in their hand
because pain or dread alarm
for satan's kingdom he o'ercame
to give his people right to claim
these signs shall surely follow them 
who on my name believe

they shall with other tongues declare
the wonders of their god
the sick beneath their hands by prayer
shall rise to prove my word
so let it be firm as his throne
stands this clear promise to his own
these signs shall surely follow them
who on my name believe

crowned with the flame of pentecost
a faithful fearless band
proclaimed his name a ransomed host
arose from every land
the lord worked with them from on high
his proven word could none deny
these signs shall surely follow them
who on my name believe

no word of thine is void of power
now promise lord is vain
be this a pentecostal hour
confirm thy word again
nor can'st thou fail thou art the same
as when of old thou did'st' proclaim
these signs shall surely follow them
who on my name believe
