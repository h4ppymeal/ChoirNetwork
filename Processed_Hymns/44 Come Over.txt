there is a land of peace and plenty
and its gates are open wide
and the pure in heart and holy
in its shelter may abide
it is not through gates of glory
that a soul must enter in
but all who would find entrance there
must leave the ways of sin

    come over come over
    to the land of corn and wine
    there is nothing can compare
    with the many holy pleasures there
    come over come over
    leave the desert plain below
    and come away away
    come over

there is bread of heaven growing
in its fair and fertile fields
and the wine of love its vineyard
to the thirsting mortal yields
there are mountain heights of glory
that await the trav’ler’s rod
and blest retreats where empty souls
draw nearer unto god

who would stay without its borders
in the desert dark and drear
when the luscious grapes of eschol
are so very very near
enter in then with rejoicing
for the lord is on your side
and in his glorious presence
evermore you shall abide
