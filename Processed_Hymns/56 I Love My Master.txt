i love i love my master
i will not go out free
for he is my redeemer
he paid the price for me
i would not leave his service
it is so sweet and blest
and in the weariest moments
he gives the truest rest

my master shed his lifeblood
my vassal life to win
and save me from the bondage
of tyrant self and sin
he chose me for his service
and gave me power to choose
that blessed perfect freedom
which i shall never lose

i would not halve my service
his only it must be
his only – who so loved me
and gave himself for me
rejoicing and adoring
henceforth my song shall be –
i love i love my master
i will not go out free
