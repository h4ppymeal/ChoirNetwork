there were ninety and nine that safely lay
in the shelter of the fold
but one was out on the hills away
far off from the gates of gold
away on the mountains wild and bare
away from the tender shepherds care
away from the tender shepherds care

lord thou hast here thy ninety and nine
are they not enough for thee
but the shepherd made answer this of mine
has wandered away from me
and although the road be rough and steep
i go to the desert to find my sheep
i go to the desert to find my sheep

but none of the ransomed ever knew
how deep were the waters crossed
nor how dark was the night the lord passed through
ere he found his sheep that was lost
out in the desert he heard its cry
sick and helpless and ready to die
sick and helpless and ready to die

lord whence are those blood drops all the way
that mark out the mountains track
they were shed for one who had gone astray
ere the shepherd could bring him back
lord whence are thy hands so rent and torn
they are pierced tonight by many a thorn
they are pierced tonight by many a thorn

and all through the mountains thunder riven
and up from the rocky steep
there arose a glad cry to the gate of heaven
rejoice i have found my sheep
and the angels echoed around the throne
rejoice for the lord brings back his own
rejoice for the lord brings back his own
