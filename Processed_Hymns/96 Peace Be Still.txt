master the tempest is raging
the billows are tossing high
the sky is oershadowed with blackness
no shelter or help is nigh
careth not thou not that we perish
how canst thou lie asleep
when each moment so madly is threatening
a grave in the angry deep

    the winds and the waves shall obey my will
    peace be still
    whether the wrath of the stormtossed sea
    or demons or men or whatever it be
    no water can swallow the ship where lies
    the master of ocean and earth and skies
    they all shall sweetly obey my will
    peace be still peace be still
    they all shall sweetly obey my will
    peace peace be still

master with anguish of spirit
i bow in my grief today
the depths of my sad heart are troubled
o waken and save i pray
torrents of sin and of anguish
sweep oer my sinking soul
and i perish i perish dear master
o hasten and take control

master the terror is over
the elements sweetly rest
earths sun in the calm lake is mirrored
and heavens within my breast
linger o blessed redeemer
leave me alone no more
and with joy i shall make the blest harbour
and rest on the blissful shore
