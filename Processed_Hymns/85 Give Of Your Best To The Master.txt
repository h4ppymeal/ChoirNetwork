give of the strength of your youth
throw your soul’s fresh glowing ardor
into the battle for truth
jesus has set the example
dauntless was he young and brave
give him your loyal devotion
give him the best that you have

    give of your best to the master
    give of the strength of your youth
    clad in salvation’s full armor
    join in the battle for truth

give of your best to the master
give him first place in your heart
give him first place in your service
consecrate every part
give and to you will be given
god his beloved son gave
gratefully seeking to serve him
give him the best that you have

give of your best to the master
naught else is worthy his love
he gave himself for your ransom
gave up his glory above
laid down his life without murmur
you from sin’s ruin to save
give him your heart’s adoration
give him the best that you have
