how to reach the masses men of every birth
for an answer jesus gave the key
and i if i be lifted up from the earth
will draw all men unto me

    lift him up…lift him up …
    still he speaks from eternity
    and i if i be lifted up from the earth
    will draw all men unto me

oh the world is hungry for the living bread
lift the saviour up for them to see
trust him and do not doubt the words that he said
ill draw all men unto me

dont exalt the preacher dont exalt the pew
preach the gospel simple full and free
prove him and you will find that promise is true
ill draw all men unto me

lift him up by living as a christian ought
let the world in you the saviour see
then men will gladly follow him who once taught
ill draw all men unto me
