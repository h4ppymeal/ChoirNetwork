wash me o lamb of god
wash me from sin
by thine atoning blood
oh make me clean
purge me from every stain
let me thine image gain
in love and mercy reign
oer all within

wash me o lamb of god
wash me from sin
i long to be like thee –
all pure within
now let the crimson tide
shed from thy wounded side
be to my heart applied
and make me clean

wash me o lamb of god
wash me from sin
i will not cannot rest
till pure within
all human skill is vain
but thou canst cleanse each stain
till not a spot remain –
made wholly clean

wash me o lamb of god
wash me from sin
by faith thy cleansing blood
now makes clean
so near art thou to me
so sweet my rest in thee –
oh blessed purity
saved saved from sin

wash me o lamb of god
wash me from sin
thou while i trust in thee
wilt keep me clean
each day to thee i bring
heart life – yea everything
saved while to thee i cling
saved from all sin
