more like the master i would ever be
more of his meekness more humility
more zeal to labor more courage to be true
more consecration for work he bids me do 

    take thou my heart i would be thine alone
    take thou my heart and make it all thine own
    purge me from sin o lord i now implore
    wash me and keep me thine forevermore

more like the master is my daily prayer
more strength to carry crosses i must bear
more earnest effort to bring his kingdom in
more of his spirit the wanderer to win

more like the master i would live and grow
more of his love to others i would show
more selfdenial like his in galilee
more like the master i long to ever be
