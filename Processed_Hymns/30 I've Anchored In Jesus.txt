upon life’s boundless ocean where mighty billows roll
i’ve fixed my hope in jesus blest anchor of my soul
when trials fierce assail me as storms are gathering o’er
i rest upon his mercy and trust him more

    i’ve anchored in jesus the storms of life i’ll brave
    i’ve anchored in jesus i fear no wind or wave
    i’ve anchored in jesus for he hath power to save
    i’ve anchored to the rock of ages

he keeps my soul from evil and gives me blessèd peace
his voice hath stilled the waters and bid their tumult cease
my pilot and deliverer to him i all confide
for always when i need him he’s at my side

he is my friend and savior in him my anchor’s cast
he drives away my sorrows and shields me from the blast
by faith i’m looking upward beyond life’s troubled sea
there i behold a haven prepared for me
