upon life’s boundless ocean where mighty billows roll
i have fixed my hope in jesus blest anchor of my soul
when trials fierce assail me as storms are gathering over
i rest upon his mercy and trust him more

    i have anchored in jesus the storms of life i will brave
    i have anchored in jesus i fear no wind or wave
    i have anchored in jesus for he hath power to save
    i have anchored to the rock of ages

he keeps my soul from evil and gives me blessèd peace
his voice hath stilled the waters and bid their tumult cease
my pilot and deliverer to him i all confide
for always when i need him he is at my side

he is my friend and savior in him my anchor’s cast
he drives away my sorrows and shields me from the blast
by faith i am looking upward beyond life’s troubled sea
there i behold a haven prepared for me
