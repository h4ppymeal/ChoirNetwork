o soul are you weary and troubled
no light in the darkness you see
there’s a light for a look at the savior
and life more abundant and free

    turn your eyes upon jesus
    look full in his wonderful face
    and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
    in the light of his glory and grace

through death into life everlasting
he passed and we follow him there
over us sin no more hath dominion—
for more than conquerors we are

his word shall not fail you—he promised
believe him and all will be well
then go to a world that is dying
his perfect salvation to tell
