pass me not o gentle saviour
hear my humble cry
while on others thou art calling
do not pass me by

    saviour saviour
    hear my humble cry
    while on others thou art calling
    do not pass me by

let me at thy throne of mercy
find a sweet relief
kneeling there in deep contrition
help my unbelief

trusting only in thy merit
would i seek thy face
heal my wounded broken spirit
save me by thy grace

thou the spring of all my comfort
more than life to me
whom have i on earth beside thee
whom in heavn but thee
