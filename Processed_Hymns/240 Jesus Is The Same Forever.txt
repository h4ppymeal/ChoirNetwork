jesus is the same forever
as of old so now today
all the host of hell endeavour
vainly to obstruct his sway
in his people’s hearts he
reigneth
finishes what he begins
jesus still “all power”
retaineth
saves his people from their
sins

jesus is the same forever
yes he heals the sick today
as of old so now he never
turns one suffering child away
he can cure the worst diseases
for he understands our frame
bore our griefs and so releases
all who dare their rights to claim

jesus is the same forever
still he says “in me abide”
from his ha no power can sever
those who in their lord confide
sweetly from all care he frees us
ours the comfort his the shame
blessed saviour precious jesus
there is no music like thy name
