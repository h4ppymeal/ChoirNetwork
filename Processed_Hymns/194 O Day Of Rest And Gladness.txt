o day of rest and gladness
o day of joy and light
o balm of care and sadness
most beautiful most bright
on thee the high and lowly
through ages joined in tune
sing holy holy holy
to the great god triune

on thee at the creation
the light first had its birth
on thee for our salvation
christ rose from depths of earth
on thee our lord victorious
the spirit sent from heavn
and thus on thee most glorious
a triple light was givn

today on weary nations
the heavnly manna falls
to holy convocations
the silver trumpet calls
where gospel light is glowing
with pure and radiant beams
and living water flowing
with soul refreshing streams

new graces ever gaining
from this our day of rest
we reach the rest remaining
to spirits of the blest
to holy ghost be praises
to father and to son
the church her voice upraises
to thee blest three in one
