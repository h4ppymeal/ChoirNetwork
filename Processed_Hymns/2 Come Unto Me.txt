hear the blessed saviour calling the oppressed
o ye heavy laden come to me and rest
come no longer tarry i your load will bear
bring me evry burden bring me evry care

    come unto me i will give you rest
    take my yoke upon you hear me and be blest
    i am meek and lowly come and trust my might
    come my yoke is easy and my burdens light

are you disappointed wandring here and there
dragging chains of doubt and loaded down with care
do unholy feelings struggle in your breast
bring your case to jesus he will give you rest

stumbling on the mountains dark with sin and shame 
stumbling towrd the pit of hells consuming flames
by the powrs of sin deluded and oppressed
hear the tender shepherd come to me and rest

have you cares of business cares of pressing debt
cares of social life or cares of hope unmet
are you by remorse of sense of guilt depressed
come right to jesus he will give you rest

have you by temptations often conquered been
has a sense of weakness brought distress within
christ will sanctify you if youll claim his best
in the holy spirit he will give you rest
