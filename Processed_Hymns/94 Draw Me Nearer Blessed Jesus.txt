i am thine o lord i have heard thy voice
and it told thy love to me
but i long to rise in the arms of faith
and be closer drawn to thee

    draw me nearer nearer blessèd lord
    to the cross where thou hast died
    draw me nearer nearer nearer blessèd lord
    to thy precious bleeding side

consecrate me now to thy service lord
by the power of grace divine
let my soul look up with a steadfast hope
and my will be lost in thine

o the pure delight of a single hour
that before thy throne i spend
when i kneel in prayer and with thee my god
i commune as friend with friend

there are depths of love that i cannot know
till i cross the narrow sea
there are heights of joy that i may not reach
till i rest in peace with thee
