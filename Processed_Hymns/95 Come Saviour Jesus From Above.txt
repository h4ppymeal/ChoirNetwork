come saviour jesus from above
assist me with thy heavenly grace
empty my heart of earthly love
and for thyself prepare the place

o let thy sacred presence fill
and set my longing spirit free
which pants to have no other will
but day and night to feast on thee

while in this region here below
no other good will i pursue
i will bid this world of noise and show
with all its glittering snares adieu

that path with humble speed i will seek
in which my saviour's footsteps shine
nor will i hear nor will i speak
of any other love but thine

henceforth may no profane delight
divide this consecrated soul
possess it thou who hast the right
as lord and master of the whole

wealth honour pleasure and what else
this shortenduring world can give
tempt as ye will my soul repels
to christ alone resolved to live

thee i can love and thee alone
with pure delight and inward bliss
to know thou tak'st me for thine own
o what a happiness is this

nothing on earth do i desire
but thy pure love within my breast
this only this will i require
and freely give up all the rest
