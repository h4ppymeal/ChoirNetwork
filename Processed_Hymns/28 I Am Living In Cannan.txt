all that draw me i have left behind
here in canaan better joys i find
peace abiding blessings unconfined
for im living in canaan now

    i am living in canaan now
    where the showers of blessing abound
    where the riches of grace in plenty are found
    i am living in canaan now

safe abiding i will never fear
for my saviour ever will be near
when i call him he will always hear
for im living in canaan now

i am drinking from a ceaseless well
here in canaan where i love to dwell
so to others i am glad to tell
that im living in canaan now

praises ever i am glad to bring
unto jesus my redeemer king
for his mercies i will shout and sing
for im living in canaan now
