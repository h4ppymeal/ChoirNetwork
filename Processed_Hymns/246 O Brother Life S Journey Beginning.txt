o brother life’s journey beginning
with courage and firmness arise
look well to the course thou art choosing
be earnest be watchful and wise
remember—two paths are before thee
and both thy attention invite
but one leadeth on to destruction
the other to joy and delight

    god help you to follow his banner
    and serve him wherever you go
    and when you are tempted my brother
    god give you the grace to say no

o brother yield not to the tempter
no matter what others may do
stand firm in the strength of the master
be loyal be faithful and true
each trial will make you the stronger
if you in the name of the lord
fight manfully under your leader
obeying the voice of his word

o brother the savior is calling
beware of the danger of sin
resist not the voice of the spirit
that whispers so gently within
god calls you to enter his service—
to live for him here day by day
and share by and by in the glory
that never shall vanish away
