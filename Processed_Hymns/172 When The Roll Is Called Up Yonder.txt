when the trumpet of the lord shall sound and time shall be no more
and the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
when the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore
and the roll is called up yonder i will be there

    when the roll    is called up yonder
    when the roll    is called up yonder
    when the roll    is called up yonder
    when the roll is called up yonder i will be there

on that bright and cloudless morning 
when the dead in christ shall rise
and the glory of his resurrection share
when his chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies
and the roll is called up yonder i will be there

let us labour for the master from the dawn till setting sun
let us talk of all his wondrous love and care
then when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
and the roll is called up yonder i will be there
