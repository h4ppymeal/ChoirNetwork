long ago in days of old stood a man of god were told
as he talked to elijah that day
his request he did repeat standing at elijahs feet
a double portion i can hear him say

    give me lord a double portion pour thy spirit on me
    thru eyes of faith thy wondrous works i can see
    but i need thy helping hand in this troubled sinful land
    give me lord a double portion from thee

as elijah stood that day to elisha he did say
ask me what i shall do unto thee
and elisha then replied walking at elijahs side
a double portion let it fall on me

lord i always to thee pray just for strength from day to day
but i see theres so much to be done
that i have to kneel anew and this favor ask of you
a double portion  this fight must be won
