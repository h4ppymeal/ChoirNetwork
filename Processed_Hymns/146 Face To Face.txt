face to face with christ my saviour
face to face – what will it be
when with rapture i behold him
jesus christ who died for me 

    face to face i shall behold him
    far beyond the starry sky
    face to face in all his glory
    i shall see him by and by 

only faintly now i see him
with the darkling veil between
but a blessed day is coming
when his glory shall be seen 

what rejoicing in his presence
when are banished grief and pain
when the crooked ways are straightened
and the dark things shall be plain 

face to face o blissful moment
face to face – to see and know
face to face with my redeemer
jesus christ who loves me so
