1 no tears in heaven no sorrows given
all will be glory in that land
there will be no sadness all will be gladness
when we shall join that happy band

    no tears no tears no tears up there
    sorrow and pain will all have flown
    no tears no tears no tears up there
    no tears in heaven will be known

glory is waiting waiting up yonder
where we shall spend an endless day
there with our savior we will be forever
where no more sorrow can dismay

some morning yonder we will cease to ponder
over things this life has brought to view
all will be clearer loved ones be dearer
in heav'n where all will be made new
