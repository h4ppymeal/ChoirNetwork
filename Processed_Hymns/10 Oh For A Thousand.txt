o for a thousand tongues to sing
my great redeemer’s praise
the glories of my god and king
the triumphs of his grace

my gracious master and my god
assist me to proclaim
to spread through all the earth abroad
the honors of thy name

jesus the name that charms our fears
that bids our sorrows cease
it is music in the sinner’s ears
it is life and health and peace

his love my heart has captive made
his captive would i be
for he was bound and scourged and died
my captive soul to free

he breaks the power of canceled sin
he sets the prisoner free
his blood can make the foulest clean
his blood availed for me

so now thy blessed name i love
thy will would ever be mine
had i a thousand hearts to give
my lord they all were thine
