if the world from you withhold of its silver and its gold
and you have to get along with meager fare
just remember in his word how he feeds the little bird
take your burden to the lord and leave it there

    leave it there leave it there
    take your burden to the lord and leave it there
    if you trust and never doubt he will surely bring you out
    take your burden to the lord and leave it there

if your body suffers pain and your health you can’t regain
and your soul is almost sinking in despair
jesus knows the pain you feel he can save and he can heal
take your burden to the lord and leave it there

when your enemies assail and your heart begins to fail
don’t forget that god in heaven answers prayer
he will make a way for you and will lead you safely through
take your burden to the lord and leave it there

when your youthful days are gone and old age is stealing on
and your body bends beneath the weight of care
he will never leave you then he’ll go with you to the end
take your burden to the lord and leave it there
