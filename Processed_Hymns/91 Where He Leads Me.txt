“take thy cross and follow follow me

    where he leads me i will follow
    where he leads me i will follow
    where he leads me i will follow
    i’ll go with him with him all the way

i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him through the garden
i’ll go with him with him all the way

i’ll go with him through the judgment
i’ll go with him through the judgment
i’ll go with him through the judgment
i’ll go with him with him all the way

he will give me grace and glory
he will give me grace and glory
