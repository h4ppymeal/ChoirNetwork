there is a call comes ringing over the restless wave
send the light send the light
there are souls to rescue there are souls to save
send the light send the light 

    send the light the blessed gospel light
    let it shine from shore to shore
    send the light and let its radiant beams
    light the world forevermore

we have heard the macedonian call today
send the light send the light
and a golden off'ring at the cross we lay
send the light send the light

let us pray that grace may everywhere abound
send the light send the light
and a christlike spirit everywhere be found
send the light send the light

let us not grow weary in the work of love
send the light send the light
let us gather jewels for a crown above
send the light send the light
