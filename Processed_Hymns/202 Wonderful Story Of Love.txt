wonderful story of love
tell it to me again
wonderful story of love
wake the immortal strain
angels with rapture announce it
shepherds with wonder receive it
sinner o won’t you believe it

    wonderful 
    wonderful
    wonderful
    wonderful story of love

wonderful story of love
though you are far away
wonderful story of love
still he doth call today
calling from calvary’s mountain
down from the crystal bright fountain
e’en from the dawn of creation

wonderful story of love
jesus provides a rest
wonderful story of love
for all the pure and blest
rest in those mansions above us
with those who’ve gone on before us
singing the rapturous chorus
