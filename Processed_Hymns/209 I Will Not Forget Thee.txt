sweet is the promise  i will not forget thee
nothing can molest or turn my soul away
een tho the night be dark within the valley
just beyond is shining an eternal day

    i will not forget thee or leave thee
    in my hands ill hold thee in my arms ill fold thee
    i will not forget thee or leave thee
    i am thy redeemer i will care for thee

trusting the promise  i will not forget thee
onward will i go with songs of joy and love
tho earth despise me tho my friends forsake me
i shall be remembered in my home above

when at the golden portals i am standing
all my tribulations all my sorrows past
how sweet to hear the blessed proclamation
enter faithful servant welcome home at last
