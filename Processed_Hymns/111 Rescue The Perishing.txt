rescue the perishing care for the dying
snatch them in pity from sin and the grave
weep oer the erring one lift up the fallen
tell them of jesus the mighty to save

    rescue the perishing 
    care for the dying
    jesus is merciful
     jesus will save

though they are slighting him still he is waiting
waiting the penitent child to receive
plead with them earnestly plead with them gently
he will forgive if they only believe

down in the human heart crushed by the tempter
feelings lie buried that grace can restore
touched by a loving heart wakened by kindness
chords that are broken will vibrate once more

rescue the perishing duty demands it
strength for thy labour the lord will provide
back to the narrow way patiently win them
tell the poor wanderer a saviour has died
