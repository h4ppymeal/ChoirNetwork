speak just a word for jesus
tell how he died for you
often repeat the story
wonderful glad and true

    speak just a word
    ever to him be true
    speak just a word
    tell what he is doing for you

speak just a word for jesus
tell how he helps you live
tell of the strength and comfort
which he will freely give 

speak just a word for jesus
do not for others wait
gladly proclaim the message
soon it will be too late 

speak just a word for jesus
why should you doubt or fear
surely his love will bless it
some one will gladly hear 

speak just a word for jesus
tell of his love for men
some one distressed may listen
willing to trust him then
