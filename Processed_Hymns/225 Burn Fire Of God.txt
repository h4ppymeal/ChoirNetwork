burn fire of god my ransomed soul possessing
pure fire thou art and i would dwell in thee
light of my life true source of every blessing
grant all my days one holy flame to be

burn fire of god thy grace and glory knowing
my cleansèd heart shall be all fire within
love all constraining tenderness oerflowing
one kindling passion other lives to win

burn fire of god thy cloven tongue bestowing
baptising me with heavenly energy
touched with live coals from off thine altar glowing
my purgèd  lips shall speak alone of thee

burn fire of god with sevenfold refining
till mirrored from my deeps thine eyes shall see
in purest gold thy perfect image shining
thy christ revealed in clear irradiancy

burn fire of god by thine own love transcending
let all i hold be thine and thine alone
heart mind and will a sacrifice ascending
consumed by fire from out thy fiery throne
