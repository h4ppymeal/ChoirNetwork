the churchs one foundation
is jesus christ her lord
she is his new creation
by water and the word
from heavn he came and sought her
to be his holy bride
with his own blood he bought her
and for her life he died

elect from evry nation
yet one oer all the earth
her charter of salvation
one lord one faith one birth
one holy name she blesses
partakes one holy food
and to one hope she presses
with evry grace endued

though with a scornful wonder
men see her sore oppressed
by schisms rent asunder
by heresies distressed
yet saints their watch are keeping
their cry goes up how long
and soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song

mid toil and tribulation
and tumult of her war
she waits the consummation
of peace forevermore
till with the vision glorious
her longing eyes are blest
and the great church victorious
shall be the church at rest

yet she on earth hath union
with the god the three in one
and mystic sweet communion
with those whose rest is won
o happy ones and holy
lord give us grace that we
like them the meek and lowly
on high may dwell with thee
