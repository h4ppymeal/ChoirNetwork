ere you left your room this morning
did you think to pray
in the name of christ our saviour
did you sue for loving favour
as a shield today

    o how praying rests the weary
    prayer will change the night to day
    so when life seems dark and dreary
    dont forget to pray

when you met with great temptation
did you think to pray
by his dying love and merit
did you claim the holy spirit
as your guide and stay

when your heart was filled with anger
did you think to pray
did you plead for grace my brother
that you might forgive another
who had crossed your way

when sore trials came upon you
did you think to pray
when your soul was bowed in sorrow
balm of gilead did you borrow
at the gates today
