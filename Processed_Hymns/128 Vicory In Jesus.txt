i heard an old old story
how a savior came from glory
how he gave his life on calvary
to save a wretch like me
i heard about his groaning
of his precious bloods atoning
then i repented of my sins
and won the victory 

    o victory in jesus
    my savior forever
    he sought me and bought me
    with his redeeming blood
    he loved me ere i knew him
    and all my love is due him
    he plunged me to victory
    beneath the cleansing flood 

i heard about his healing
of his cleansing powr revealing
how he made the lame to walk again
and caused the blind to see
and then i cried dear jesus
come and heal my broken spirit
and somehow jesus came and brot
to me the victory 

i heard about a mansion
he has built for me in glory
and i heard about the streets of gold
beyond the crystal sea
about the angels singing
and the old redemption story
and some sweet day ill sing up there
the song of victory
