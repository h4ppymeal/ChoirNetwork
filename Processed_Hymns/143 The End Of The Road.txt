when i come to the end of the long long road
the shadows will flee away
and i’ll stand in the glorious light of god
where dwelleth eternal day

    when i come to the end the end of the road
    to the land of eternity
    when i come to the end of life’s long road
    the face of my lord i’ll see

looking back o’er the years that were hard and drear
the hand of the christ i’ll see
while my heart will go forth with a song of praise
because of his love for me

when i come to the end of the long long road
and trials will all be past
i shall look in the face of my dearest friend
safe home in his heav’n at last
