when i come to the end of the long long road
the shadows will flee away
and i will stand in the glorious light of god
where dwelleth eternal day

    when i come to the end the end of the road
    to the land of eternity
    when i come to the end of life’s long road
    the face of my lord i will see

looking back over the years that were hard and drear
the hand of the christ i will see
while my heart will go forth with a song of praise
because of his love for me

when i come to the end of the long long road
and trials will all be past
i shall look in the face of my dearest friend
safe home in his heav’n at last
