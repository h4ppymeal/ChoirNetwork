impatient heart be still
what though he tarries long
what though the triumph song
is still is still delayed
thou hast his promise sure
and that is all secure
be not afraid be not afraid

    be still be still
    impatient heart be still

my eager heart be still
thy lord will surely come
and take thee to his home
with him with him to dwell
it may not be today
and yet my soul it may
i cannot tell i cannot tell

my anxious heart be still
watch work and pray and then
it will not matter when
thy lord thy lord shall come
at midnight or at noon
he cannot come too soon
to take thee home to take thee home
