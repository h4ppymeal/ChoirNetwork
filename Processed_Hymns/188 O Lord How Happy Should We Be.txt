o lord how happy should we be
if we could cast our care on thee
if we from self could rest
and feel at heart that one above
in perfect wisdom perfect love
is working for the best

how far from this our daily life
ever disturbed by anxious strife
by sudden wild alarms
o could we but relinquish all
our earthly props and simply fall
on thy almighty arms

could we but kneel and cast our load
e'en while we pray upon our god
then rise with lightened cheer
sure that the father who is nigh
to still the famished raven's cry
will hear in that we fear

lord make these faithless hearts of ours
such lesson learns from birds and flowers
make them from self to cease
leave all things to a father's will
and taste before him lying still
e'en in affliction peace
