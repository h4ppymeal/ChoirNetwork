1 when i saw the cleansing fountain
open wide for all my sin
i obeyed the spirit’s wooing
when he said “wilt thou be clean”

    i will praise him i will praise him
    praise the lamb for sinners slain
    give him glory all ye people
    for his blood can wash away each stain

tho the way seems straight and narrow
all i claimed was swept away
my ambitions plans and wishes
at my feet in ashes lay

blessed be the name of jesus
i’m so glad he took me in
he’s forgiven my transgressions
he has cleansed my heart from sin

glory glory to the father
glory glory to the son
glory glory to the spirit
glory to the three in one
