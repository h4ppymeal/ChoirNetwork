there is a home eternal
beautiful and bright
where sweet joys supernal
never are dimm’d by night
whiterob’d angels are singing
ever around the bright throne
when o when shall i see thee
beautiful beautiful home

    home beautiful home
    bright beautiful home
    home home of our saviour
    bright beautiful home

flow’rs are ever springing
in that home so fair
thousands of children are singing
praises to jesus there

how they swell the glad anthems
ever around the bright throne
when o when shall i see thee
beautiful beautiful home

soon shall i join that anthem
far beyond the sky
christ became my ransom
why should i fear to die
soon my eyes shall behold him
seated upon the bright throne
then o then shall i see thee
beautiful beautiful home
