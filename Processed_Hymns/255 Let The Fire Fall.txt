they were gathered in an upper chamber
as commanded by the risen lord
and the promise of the father
there they sought with one accord
when the holy ghost from heaven descended
like a rushing wind and tongues of fire
so dear lord we seek thy blessing
come with glory now our hearts inspire

    let the fire fall let the fire fall
    let the fire from heaven fall
    we are waiting and expecting
    now in faith dear lord we call
    let the fire fall let the fire fall
    on thy promise we depend
    from the glory of thy presence
    let the pentecostal fire descend

as elijah we would raise the altar
for our testimony clear and true
christ the saviour loving healer
coming lord baptizer too
ever flowing grace and full salvation
for a ruined race thy love has planned
for this blessed revelation
for thy written word we dare to stand

tis the covenanted promise given
to as many as the lord shall call
to the fathers and their children
to thy people one and all
so rejoicing in thy word unfailing
we draw nigh in faith thy power to know
come o come thou burning spirit
set our hearts with heavnly fire aglow

with a living coal from off thy altar
touch our lips to swell thy wondrous praise
to extol thee bless adore thee
and our songs of worship raise
let the cloud of glory now descending
fill our hearts with holy ecstasy
come in all thy glorious fulness
blessed holy spirit have thy way
