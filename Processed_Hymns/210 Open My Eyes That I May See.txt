open my eyes that i may see
glimpses of truth thou hast for me
place in my hands the wonderful key
that shall unclasp and set me free
 
open my ears that i may hear
voices of truth thou sendest clear
and while the wave notes fall on my ear
everything false will disappear
 
open my mouth and let me bear
gladly the warm truth everywhere
open my heart and let me prepare
love with thy children thus to share

open my mind that i may read 
more of thy love in word and deed 
what shall i fear while yet thou dost  lead
only for light from thee i plead
silently now i wait for thee readymy god 
thy will to see pen my mind illuminate me
spirit divine

open my way that i may bring
trophies of grace to thee my king
echoed in love thy word shall out ring
sweet as the note that angels sing 
silently now i wait for thee
ready my god thy will to see
open my way illuminate me spirit divine
