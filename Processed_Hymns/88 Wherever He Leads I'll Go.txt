take up thy cross and follow me
i heard my master say
i gave my life to ransom thee
surrender your all today

    wherever he leads ill go
    wherever he leads ill go
    ill follow my christ who loves me so
    wherever he leads ill go

he drew me closer to his side
i sought his will to know
and in that will i now abide
wherever he leads ill go

it may be through the shadows dim
or oer the stormy sea
i take my cross and follow him
wherever he leadeth me

my heart my life my all i bring
to christ who loves me so
he is my master lord and king
wherever he leads ill go
