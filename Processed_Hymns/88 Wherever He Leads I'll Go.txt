take up thy cross and follow me
i heard my master say
i gave my life to ransom thee
surrender your all today

    wherever he leads i will go
    wherever he leads i will go
    i will follow my christ who loves me so
    wherever he leads i will go

he drew me closer to his side
i sought his will to know
and in that will i now abide
wherever he leads i will go

it may be through the shadows dim
or over the stormy sea
i take my cross and follow him
wherever he leadeth me

my heart my life my all i bring
to christ who loves me so
he is my master lord and king
wherever he leads i will go
