another year is dawning dear father let it be
in working or in waiting another year with thee
another year of progress another year of praise
another year of proving thy presence all the days

another year of mercies another year of grace
another year of gladness the glory of thy face
another year of leaning upon thy loving breast
another year of trusting of quiet happy rest

another year of service of witness for thy love
another year of training for holier work above
another year is dawning dear father let it be
on earth or else in heaven another year for thee
