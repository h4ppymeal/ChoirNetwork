lord speak to me that i may speak
in living echoes of thy tone
as thou hast sought so let me seek
thy erring children lost and lone

oh lead me lord that i may lead
the wandering and the wavering feet
o feed me lord that i may feed
thy hungering ones with manna sweet

oh strengthen me that while i stand
firm on the rock and strong in thee
i may stretch out a loving hand
to wrestlers with the troubled sea

oh teach me lord that i may teach
the precious things thou dost impart
and wing my words that they may reach
the hidden depths of many a heart

oh give thine own sweet rest to me
that i may speak with soothing power
a word in season as from thee
to weary ones in needful hour

oh fill me with thy fulness lord
until my very heart oerflow
in kindling thought and glowing word
thy love to tell thy praise to show

oh use me lord use even me
just as thou wilt and how and where
until thy blessed face i see
thy rest thy joy thy glory share
