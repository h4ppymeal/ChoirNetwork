when upon lifes billows you are tempest tossed
when you are discouraged thinking all is lost
count your many blessings name them one by one
and it will surprise you what the lord hath done

    count your blessings name them one by one
    count your blessings see what god hath done
    count your blessings name them one by one
    count your many blessings see what god hath done

are you ever burdened with a load of care
does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear
count your many blessings evry doubt will fly
and you will be singing as the days go by

when you look at others with their lands and gold
think that christ has promised you his wealth untold
count your many blessings money cannot buy
your reward in heaven nor your home on high

so amid the conflict whether great or small
do not be discouraged god is over all
count your many blessings angels will attend
help and comfort give you to your journeys end
