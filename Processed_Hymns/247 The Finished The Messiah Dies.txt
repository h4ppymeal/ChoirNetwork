tis finished the messiah dies 
cut off for sins but not his own 
accomplished is the sacrifice 
the great redeeming work is done 

the veil is rent in christ alone 
the living way to heaven is seen 
the middle wall is broken down 
and all the world may enter in 

tis finished all my guilt and pain 
i want no sacrifice beside 
for me for me the lamb is slain 
tis finished i am justified 

the reign of sin and death is oer 
and all may live from sin set free 
satan hath lost his mortal power 
tis swallowed up in victory
