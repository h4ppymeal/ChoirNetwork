thy word is a lamp to my feet
a light to my path always
to guide and to save me from sin
and show me the heavenly way

    thy word have i hid in my heart…
    that i might not sin against thee…
    that i might not sin that i might not sin
    thy word have i hid in my heart

for ever o lord is thy word
established and fixed on high
thy faithfulness to all men
abideth for ever nigh

at morning at noon and at night
i ever will give thee praise
for thou art my portion o lord
and shall be though all my days

through him whom thy word hath foretold
the saviour and morning star
salvation and peace have been brought
to those who have strayed afar
