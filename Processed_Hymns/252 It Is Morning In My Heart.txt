all the darkness of the night has passed away
it is morning in my heart
i am living in the sunlight of the day
it is morning in my heart

    it is morning it is morning in my heart
    jesus made the gloomy shadows all depart
    songs of gladness now i sing
    for since jesus is my king
    it is morning it is morning in my heart

i can the songbirds their refain 
it is morning in my heart
and i know that life for me begins
again it is morning in my heart

christ has made the world a paradise to me
it is morning in my heart
every duty in the light of love i see
it is morning in my heart

joy has come to dwell with me forever 
it is morning in my heart 
i shall sing when it reach the other shore
it is morning in my heart
