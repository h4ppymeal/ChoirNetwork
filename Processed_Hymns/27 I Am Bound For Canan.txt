storms do not alarm me they sometime must cease
trials cannot harm me for i have blessed peace
all ive left behind me i long for no more
better things shall find me on canaans shore

    let those who will stay in egypt land
    i am bound for canaan
    where milk and honey flowing shall every need supply
    all battles fought and the victory won
    peace and joy my portion
    my soul shall rest on its shore by and by

troubles do not fret me they cannot abide
though they may beset me in jesus i will hide
all the worlds commotion about me may roam
theres no stormy ocean on canaans shore

i in grace abiding am trying to stay
in the shadow hiding of canaans perfect day
all i trust may fail me twill matter no more
nothing can assail me on canaans shore
