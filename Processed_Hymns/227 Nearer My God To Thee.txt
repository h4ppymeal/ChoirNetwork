nearer my god to thee nearer to thee
e’en though it be a cross that raiseth me
still all my song shall be nearer my god to thee

though like the wanderer the sun gone down
darkness be over me my rest a stone
yet in my dreams i’d be nearer my god to thee

there let the way appear steps unto heav’n
all that thou sendest me in mercy given
angels to beckon me nearer my god to thee

then with my waking thoughts bright with thy praise
out of my stony griefs bethel i’ll raise
so by my woes to be nearer my god to thee

or if on joyful wing cleaving the sky
sun moon and stars forgot upward i’ll fly
still all my song shall be nearer my god to thee

there in my father’s home safe and at rest
there in my savior’s love perfectly blest
age after age to be nearer my god to thee
