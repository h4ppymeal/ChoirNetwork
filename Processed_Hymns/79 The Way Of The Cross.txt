i must needs go home by the way of the cross
theres no other way but this 
i shall neer get sight of the gates of light 
if the way of the cross i miss

    the way of the cross leads home
    the way of the cross leads home
    it is sweet to know as i onward go
    the way of the cross leads home

i must needs go on in the bloodsprinkled way
the path that the saviour trod 
if i ever climb to the heights sublime 
where the soul is at home with god

then i bid farewell to the way of the world 
to walk in it never more 
for my lord says come and seek my home
where he waits at the open door
