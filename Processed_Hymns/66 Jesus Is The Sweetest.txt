there have been names that i have loved to hear
but never has there been a name so dear
to this heart of mine as the name divine
the precious precious name of jesus

    jesus is the sweetest name i know
    and he’s just the same as his lovely name
    and that’s the reason why i love him so
    oh jesus is the sweetest name i know

there is no name in earth or heav’n above
that we should give such honor and such love
as the blessèd name let us all acclaim
that wondrous glorious name of jesus

and some day i shall see him face to face
to thank and praise him for his wondrous grace
which he gave to me when he made me free
the blessèd son of god called jesus
