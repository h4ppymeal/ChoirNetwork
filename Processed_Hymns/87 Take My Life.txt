take my life and let it be
consecrated lord to thee
take my moments and my days
let them flow in ceaseless praise

take my hands and let them move
at the impulse of thy love
take my feet and let them be
swift and beautiful for thee

take my voice and let me sing
always only for my king
take my lips and let them be
filled with messages from thee

take my silver and my gold
not a mite would i withhold
take my intellect and use
every power as thou shalt choose

take my will and make it thine
it shall be no longer mine
take my heart it is thine own
it shall be thy royal throne

take my love my lord i pour
at thy feet its treasurestore
take myself and i will be
ever only all for thee
