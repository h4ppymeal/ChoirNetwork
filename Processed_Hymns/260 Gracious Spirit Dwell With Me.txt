gracious spirit dwell with me
i myself would gracious be
and with words that help and heal
would thy life in mine reveal
and with actions bold and meek
would for christ my savior speak

truthful spirit dwell with me
i myself would truthful be
and with wisdom kind and clear
let thy life in mine appear
and with actions brotherly
speak my lordâ€™s sincerity

mighty spirit dwell with me
i myself would mighty be
mighty so as to prevail
where unaided man must fail
ever by a mighty hope
pressing on and bearing up

holy spirit dwell with me
i myself would holy be
separate from sin i would
choose and cherish all things good
and whatever i can be
give to him who gave me thee
