come o my god the promise seal
this mountain sin remove
now in my waiting soul reveal
the virtue of thy love

i want thy life thy purity
thy righteousness brought in
i ask desire and trust in thee
to be redeemed from sin

anger and sloth desire and pride
this moment be subdued
be cast in the crimson tide
of my redeemers blood

saviour to thee my soul looks up
my present saviour thou
in all the confidence of hope
i claim the blessing now

â€˜tis done thou dost this moment save
with full salvation bless
redemption through thy blood i have
and spotless love and peace
