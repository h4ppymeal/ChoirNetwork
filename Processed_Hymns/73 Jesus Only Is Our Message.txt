jesus only is our message
jesus all our theme shall be
we will lift up jesus ever
jesus only will we see

    jesus only jesus ever
    jesus all in all we sing
    saviour sanctifier healer
    baptizer and coming king

jesus only is our saviour
all our guilt he bore away
all our righteousness he gives us
all our strength from day to day

jesus is our sanctifier
cleansing us from self and sin
and with all his spirit's fulness
filling all our hearts within

jesus only is our healer
all our sicknesses he bare
and his risen life and fulness
all his members still may share

jesus only is our power
his the gift of pentecost
jesus breathe thy power upon us
fill us with the holy ghost

and for jesus we are waiting
listening for the trumpet's sound
then it will be us and jesus
living ever with our god
