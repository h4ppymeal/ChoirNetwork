what a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
since jesus came into my heart 
i have light in my soul for which long i had sought
since jesus came into my heart

    since jesus came into my heart
    since jesus came into my heart
    floods of joy over my soul like the sea billows roll
    since jesus came into my heart

i have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray 
since jesus came into my heart 
and my sins which were many are all washed away
since jesus came into my heart

i am possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure
since jesus came into my heart
and no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure
since jesus came into my heart

there is a light in the valley of death now for me
since jesus came into my heart
and the gates of the city beyond i can see
since jesus came into my heart

i shall go there to dwell in that city i know
since jesus came into my heart 
and i am happy so happy as onward i go 
since jesus came into my heart
