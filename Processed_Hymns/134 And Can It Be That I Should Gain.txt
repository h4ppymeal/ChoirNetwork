and can it be that i should gain
an interest in the saviour's blood
died he for me who caused his pain
for me who him to death pursued
amazing love how can it be
that thou my god shouldst die for me

it is mystery all the immortal dies
who can explore his strange design
in vain the first born seraph tries
to sound the depth of love divine
it is mercy all let earth adore
let angelminds inquire no more

he left his father's throne above
so free so infinite his grace
emptied himself of all but love
and bled for adam's helpless race
it is mercy all immense and free
for o my god it found out me

long my imprisoned spirit lay
fast bound in sin and nature's night
thine eye diffused a quickening ray
i woke the dungeon flamed with light
my chains fell off my heart was free
i rose went forth and followed thee

no condemnation now i dread
jesus and all in him is mine
alive in him my living head
and clothed in righteousness divine
bold i approach the eternal throne
and claim the crown through christ my own
