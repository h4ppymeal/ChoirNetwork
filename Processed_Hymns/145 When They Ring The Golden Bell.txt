there is a land beyond the river
that we call the sweet forever
and we only reach that shore by faith’s decree
one by one we will gain the portals
there to dwell with the immortals
when they ring the golden bells for you and me

    do not you hear the bells now ringing
    do not you hear the angels singing
    it is the glory hallelujah jubilee
    in that faroff sweet forever
    just beyond the shining river
    when they ring the golden bells for you and me

we shall know no sin or sorrow
in that haven of tomorrow
when our barque shall sail beyond the silver sea
we shall only know the blessing
of our father’s sweet caressing
when they ring the golden bells for you and me

when our days shall know their number
and in death we sweetly slumber
when the king commands the spirit to be free
nevermore with anguish laden
we shall reach that lovely eden
when they ring the golden bells for you and me
