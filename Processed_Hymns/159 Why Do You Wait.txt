why do you wait dear brother
oh why do you tarry so long
your saviour is waiting to give you
a place in his sanctified throng

    why not why not
    why not come to him now
    why not why not
    why not come to him now

what do you hope dear brother
to gain by a further delay
there is no one to save you but jesus
there is no other way but his way

do you not feel dear brother
his spirit now striving within
oh why not accept his salvation
and throw off thy burden of sin

why do you wait dear brother
the harvest is passing away
your saviour is longing to bless you
there is danger and death in delay
