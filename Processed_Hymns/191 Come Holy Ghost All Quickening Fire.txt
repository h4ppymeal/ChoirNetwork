come holy ghost allquickening fire
come and my hallowed heart inspire
sprinkled with the atoning blood
now to my soul thyself reveal
thy mighty working let me feel
and know that i am born of god

humble and teachable and mild
o may i as a little child
my lowly masterâ€™s steps pursue
be anger to my soul unknown
hate envy jealousy be gone
in love create thou all things new

let earth no more my heart divide
with christ may i be crucified
to thee with my whole soul aspire
dead to the world and all its toys
its idle pomp and fading joys
be thou alone my one desire

my will be swallowed up in thee
light in thy light still may i see
beholding thee with open face
called the full power of faith to prove
let all my hallowed heart be love
and all my sinless life be praise
