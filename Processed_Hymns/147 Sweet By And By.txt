theres a land that is fairer than day
and by faith we can see it afar
for the father waits over the way
to prepare us a dwelling place there

    in the sweet by and by
    we shall meet on that beautiful shore
    in the sweet by and by
    we shall meet on that beautiful shore

we shall sing on that beautiful shore
the melodious songs of the blessed
and our spirits shall sorrow no more
not a sigh for the blessing of rest

to our bountiful father above
we will offer our tribute of praise
for the glorious gift of his love
and the blessings that hallow our days
