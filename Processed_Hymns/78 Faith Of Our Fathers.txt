faith of our fathers living still
in spite of dungeon fire and sword
o how our hearts beat high with joy
wheneer we hear that glorious word

    faith of our fathers holy faith
    we will be true to thee till death

faith of our fathers we will strive
to win all nations unto thee
and through the truth that comes from god
mankind shall then be truly free

faith of our fathers we will love
both friend and foe in all our strife
and preach thee too as love knows how
by kindly words and virtuous life
