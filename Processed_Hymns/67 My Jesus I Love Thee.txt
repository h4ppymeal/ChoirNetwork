my jesus i love thee i know thou art mine
for thee all the follies of sin i resign
my gracious redeemer my saviour art thou
if ever i loved thee my jesus tis now

i love thee because thou hast first loved me
and purchased my pardon on calvarys tree
i love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow
if ever i loved thee my jesus tis now

ill love thee in life i will love thee in death
and praise thee as long as thou lendest me breath
and say when the deathdew lies cold on my brow
if ever i loved thee my jesus tis now

in mansions of glory and endless delight
ill ever adore thee in heaven so bright
ill sing with the glittering crown on my brow
if ever i loved thee my jesus tis now
