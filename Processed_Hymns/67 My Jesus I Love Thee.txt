my jesus i love thee i know thou art mine
for thee all the follies of sin i resign
my gracious redeemer my saviour art thou
if ever i loved thee my jesus it is now

i love thee because thou hast first loved me
and purchased my pardon on calvary's tree
i love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow
if ever i loved thee my jesus it is now

i will love thee in life i will love thee in death
and praise thee as long as thou lendest me breath
and say when the deathdew lies cold on my brow
if ever i loved thee my jesus it is now

in mansions of glory and endless delight
i will ever adore thee in heaven so bright
i will sing with the glittering crown on my brow
if ever i loved thee my jesus it is now
