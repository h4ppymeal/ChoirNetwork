years i spent in vanity and pride
caring not my lord was crucified
knowing not it was for me he died
on calvary

    mercy there was great and grace was free
    pardon there was multiplied to me
    there my burden'd soul found liberty
    at calvary

by god's word at last my sin i learned
then i trembl'd at the law i would spurn'd
till my guilty soul imploring turned
to calvary

now i have given to jesus everything
now i gladly own him as my king
now my raptured soul can only sing
of calvary

oh the love that drew salvation's plan
oh the grace that brought it down to man
oh the mighty gulf that god did span
at calvary
