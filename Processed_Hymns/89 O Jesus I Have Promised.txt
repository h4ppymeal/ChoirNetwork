o jesus i have promised
to serve thee to the end
be thou for ever near me
my master and my friend
i shall not fear the battle
if thou art by my side
nor wander from the pathway
if thou wilt be my guide

o let me feel thee near me
the world is ever near
i see the sights that dazzle
the tempting sounds i hear
my foes are ever near me
around me and within
but jesus draw thou nearer
and shield my soul from sin

o let me hear thee speaking
in accents clear and still
above the storms of passion
the murmurs of selfwill
o speak to reassure me
to hasten or control
o speak and make me listen
thou guardian of my soul

o jesus thou hast promised
to all who follow thee
that where thou art in glory
there shall thy servant be
and jesus i have promised
to serve thee to the end
o give me grace to follow
my master and my friend

o let me see thy footmarks
and in them plant mine own
my hope to follow duly
is in thy strength alone
o guide me call me draw me
uphold me to the end
and then in heav'n receive me
my saviour and my friend
