come sing the praise of jesus
sing his love with hearts aflame
sing his wondrous birth of mary
when to save the world he came
tell the life he lived for others
and his mighty deeds proclaim
for jesus christ is king

    praise and glory be to jesus
    praise and glory be to jesus
    praise and glory be to jesus
    for jesus christ is king

when foes arose and slew him
he was victor in the fight
over death and hell he triumphed
in his resurrectionmight
he has raised our fallen manhood
and enthroned it in the height
for jesus christ is king

there’s joy for all who serve him
more than human tongue can say
there is pardon for the sinner
and the night is turned to day
there is healing for our sorrows
there is music all the way
for jesus christ is king

we witness to his beauty
and we spread his love abroad
and we cleave the hosts of darkness
with the spirit’s piercing sword
we will lead the souls in prison
to the freedom of the lord
for jesus christ is king

to jesus be the glory
the dominion and the praise
he is lord of all creation
he is guide of all our ways
and the world shall be his empire
in the fulness of the days
for jesus christ is king
