theres a great day coming a great day coming
theres a great day coming by and by
when the saints and the sinners shall be parted left and right
are you ready for that day to come

    are you ready are you ready
    are you ready for the judgment day
    are you ready are you ready
    for the judgment day

theres a bright day coming a bright day coming
theres a bright day coming by and by
but its brightness shall only come to them that love the lord
are you ready for that day to come

theres a sad day coming a sad day coming
theres a sad day coming by and by
when the sinner shall hear his doom depart i know ye not
are you ready for that day to come
