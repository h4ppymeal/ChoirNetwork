crown him with many crowns
the lamb upon his throne
hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
all music but its own
awake my soul and sing
of him who died for thee
and hail him as thy matchless king
through all eternity

crown him the lord of life
who triumphed oer the grave
and rose victorious in the strife
for those he came to save
his glories now we sing
who died and rose on high
who died eternal life to bring
and lives that death may die

crown him the lord of love
behold his hands and side
rich wounds yet visible above
in beauty glorified
no angels in the sky
can fully bear that sight
but downward bends their burning eye
at mysteries so bright

crown him the lord of years
the potentate of time
creator of the rolling spheres
ineffably sublime
all hail redeemer hail
for thou hast died for me
thy praise shall never never fail
throughout eternity
