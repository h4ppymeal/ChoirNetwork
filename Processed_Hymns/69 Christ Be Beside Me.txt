christ beside me
christ before me
christ behind me
king of my heart
christ within me
christ below me
christ above me
never to part

christ on my right hand
christ on my left hand
christ all around me
shield in the strife
christ in my sleeping
christ in my sitting
christ in my rising
light of my life

chist be in all hearts thinking about me
christ be in all tongues telling of me
christ be the vision in eyes that see me 
in ears that hear me 
chist ever be

christ beside me
christ before me
christ behind me
king of my heart
christ within me
christ below me
christ above me
never to part
