anywhere with jesus i can safely go
anywhere he leads me in this world below
anywhere without him dearest joys would fade
anywhere with jesus i am not afraid

    anywhere any where
    fear i cannot know
    anywhere with jesus
    i can safely go 

anywhere with jesus i am not alone
other friends may fail me he is still my own
tho his hand may lead me over the dreariest ways
anywhere with jesus is a house of praise

anywhere with jesus over land and sea
telling souls in darkness of salvation free
ready as he summons me to go or stay
anywhere with jesus when he points the way

anywhere with jesus i can go to sleep
when the darkning shadows round about me creep
knowing i shall waken never more to roam
anywhere with jesus will be home sweet home
