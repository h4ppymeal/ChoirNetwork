search me o god and know my heart today
try me o lord and know my thoughts i pray
see if there be some wicked way in me
cleanse me from every sin and set me free

i praise thee lord for cleansing me from sin
fulfil thy word and make me pure within
fill me with fire where once i burned with shame
grant my desire to magnify thy name

lord take my life and make it wholly thine
fill my poor heart with thy great love divine
take all my will my passion self and pride
i now surrender – lord in me abide

o holy ghost revival comes from thee
send a revival – start the work in me
thy word declares thou wilt supply our need
for blessing now o lord i humbly plead
