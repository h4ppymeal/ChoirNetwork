tempted and tried were oft made to wonder
why it should be thus all the day long
while there are others living about us
never molested tho in the wrong

    farther along well know all about it
    farther along well understand why
    cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
    well understand it all by and by

when death has come and taken our loved ones
it leaves our home so lonely and drear
then do we wonder why others prosper
living so wicked year after year

faithful till death said our loving master
a few more days to labour and wait
toils of the road will then seem as nothing
as we sweep through the beautiful gate

when we see jesus coming in glory
when he comes from his home in the sky
then we shall meet him in that bright mansion
well understand it all by and by
