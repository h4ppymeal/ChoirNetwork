go labour on spend and be spent
thy joy to do the fathers will
it is the way the master went
should not the servant tread it still

go labour on tis not for nought
thy earthly loss is heavnly gain
men heed thee love thee praise thee not
the master praises what are men

men die in darkness at your side
without a hope to cheer the tomb
take up the torch and wave it wide
the torch that lights times thickest gloom

toil on and in thy toil rejoice
for toil comes rest for exile home
soon shalt thou hear the bridegrooms voice
the midnight peal behold i come
