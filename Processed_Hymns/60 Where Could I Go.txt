living below in this old sinful world
hardly a comfort can afford
striving alone to face temptations sore
where could i go but to the lord

    where could i go o where could i go
    seeking a refuge for my soul
    needing a friend to save me in the end
    where could i go but to the lord

neighbours are kind i love them every one
we get along in sweet accord
but when my soul needs manna from above
where could i go but to the lord

life here is grand with friends i love so dear
comfort i get from gods own word
yet when i face the chilling hand of death
where could i go but to the lord
