wonderful grace of jesus greater than all my sin
how shall my tongue describe it
where shall its praise begin
taking away my burden setting my spirit free
o the wonderful grace of jesus reaches me

    wonderful the matchless grace of jesus
    the matchless grace of jesus
    deeper than the mighty rolling sea
    the rolling sea
    wonderful grace all sufficient for me for even
    higher than the mountain sparkling like a fountain
    all sufficient grace for even me
    broader than the scope of my transgressions
    sing it
    greater far than all my sin and shame
    my sin and shame
    o magnify the precious name of jesus
    praise his name

wonderful grace of jesus reaching to all the lost
by it i have been pardoned saved to the uttermost
chains have been torn asunder giving me liberty
o the wonderful grace of jesus reaches me

wonderful grace of jesus reaching the most defiled
by its transforming power
making me gods dear child
purchasing peace and heaven for all eternity
and the wonderful grace of jesus reaches me
