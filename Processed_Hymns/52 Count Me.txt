when you count the ones who love the lord
count me count me
when you count up those who trust his word
count me count me

    count me with the children of the heavenly king
    count me with the servants who would service bring
    count me with the ransomed who his praises sing
    count me… count me…

when you count up those who re saved by grace
count me count me
who have found in christ a hiding place
count me count me

when you count up those who do the right
count me count me
who are walking in the gospel light
count me count me

when you count up those who forward press
count me count me
who shall gain the crown of righteousness
count me count me
