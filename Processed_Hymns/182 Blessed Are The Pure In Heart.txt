blessed are the pure in heart
they have learned the angelart
while on earth in heaven to be
god by sense unseen to see
cleansed from sins offensive stain
fellowship with him they gain
nearness likeness to their lord
their exceeding great reward

worshipping in spirit now
in his inner court they bow
bow before the brightening vail
gods own radiance through it hail
serious simple of intent
teachably intelligent
rapt they search the written word
till his very voice is heard

in creation him they own
meet him in its haunts alone
most amidst its sabbath calm
morning light and evening balm
him they still through busier life
trust in pain and care and strife
these like clouds oer noontide blaze
temper not conceal his rays

hallowed thus their every breath
dying they shall not see death
with the lord in paradise
till like his their bodies rise
nearer than the seraphim
in their flesh shall saints see him
with the father in the son
through the spirit ever one
