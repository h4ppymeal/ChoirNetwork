jesus allatoning lamb
thine and only thine i am
take my body spirit soul
only thou possess the whole

thou my one thing needful be
let me ever cleave to thee
let me choose the better part
let me give thee all my heart

fairer than the sons of men
do not let me turn again
leave the fountainhead of bliss
stoop to worldly happiness

all my treasure is above
all my riches is thy love
who the worth of love can tell
infinite unsearchable
