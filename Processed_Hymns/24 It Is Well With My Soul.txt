when peace like a river attendeth my way
when sorrows like sea billows roll
whatever my lot thou hast taught me to say
it is well it is well with my soul

    it is well    with my soul   
    it is well it is well with my soul

though satan should buffet though' trials should come
let this blest assurance control
that christ has regarded my helpless estate
and hath she would his own blood for my soul

my sin  oh the bliss of this glorious thought 
my sin  not in part but the whole 
is nailed to his cross and i bear it no more
praise the lord praise the lord o my soul

for me be it christ be it christ hence to live
if jordan above me shall roll
no pang shall be mine for in death as in life
thou wilt whisper thy peace to my soul

but lord it is for thee for thy coming we wait
the sky not the grave is our goal
oh trump of the angel oh voice of the lord
blessed hope blessed rest of my soul
