i must tell jesus all of my trials
i cannot bear these burdens alone
in my distress he kindly will help me
he ever loves and care for his own

    i must tell jesus i must tell jesus
    i cannot bear my burdens alone
    i must tell jesus i must tell jesus
    jesus will help me jesus alone

i must tell jesus all of my troubles
he is a kind compassionate friend
if i but ask him he will deliver
make of my troubles quickly an end

tempted and tried i need a great saviour
one who can help my burdens to bear
i must tell jesus i must tell jesus
he all my cares and sorrows will share

o how the world to evil allures me
o how my heart is tempted to sin
i must tell jesus and he will help me
over the world the victory to win
