if i walk in the pathway of duty
if i work till the close of the day
i shall see the great king in his beauty
when ive gone the last mile of the way

when ive gone the last mile of the way
i will rest at the close of the day
and i know there are joys that await me
when ive gone the last mile of the way

if for christ i proclaim the glad story
if i seek for his sheep gone astray
i am sure he will show me his glory
when ive gone the last mile of the way

here the dearest of ties we must sever
tears of sorrow are seen everyday
but no sickness no sighing forever
when ive gone the last mile of the way

and if here i have earnestly striven
and have tried all his will to obey
twill enhance all the rapture of heaven
when ive gone the last mile of the way
