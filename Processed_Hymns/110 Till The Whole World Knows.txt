i will tell to all that god is love
for the world has never known
the great compassion of his heart
for the wayward and the lone

    till the whole world knows
    till the whole world knows
    i will shout and sing of christ my king
    till the whole world knows

ill tell of mercys boundless tide
like the waters of the sea
that covers every sin of man
tis salvation full and free

ill tell of grace that keeps the soul
of abiding peace within
of faith that overcomes the world
with its tumult and its din

eternal glory is the goal
that awaits the sons of light
eternal darkness black as death
for the children of the night
