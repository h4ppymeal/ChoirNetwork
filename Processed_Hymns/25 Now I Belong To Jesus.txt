jesus my lord will love me forever
from him no powr of evil can sever
he gave his life to ransom my soul
now i belong to him

    now i belong to jesus
    jesus belongs to me
    not for the years of time alone
    but for eternity

once i was lost in sins degradation
jesus came down to bring me salvation
lifted me up from sorrow and shame
now i belong to him

now i belong to jesus
jesus belongs to me
not for the years of time alone
but for eternity

joy floods my soul for jesus has saved me
freed me from sin that long had enslaved me
his precious blood he came to redeem
now i belong to him

now i belong to jesus
jesus belongs to me
not for the years of time alone
but for eternity
