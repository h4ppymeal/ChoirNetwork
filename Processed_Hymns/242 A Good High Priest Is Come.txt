a good high priest is come
supplying aarons place
and taking up his room
dispensing life and grace
the law by aarons priesthood came
but grace and truth by jesus name

he once temptations knew 
of every sort and kind
that he might succor show
to every tempted mind
in every point the lamb was tried
like us and then for us he died

he died but lives again
and by the throne he stands
there shows how he was slain
opening his pierc√®d hands
our priest abides and pleads the cause
of us who have transgressed his laws

i other priests disclaim
and laws and offrings too
none but the bleeding lamb
the mighty work can do
he shall have all the praise for he 
has loved and died and lives for me
