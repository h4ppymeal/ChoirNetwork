i know not why god’s wondrous grace
to me he hath made known
nor why unworthy christ in love
redeemed me for his own

    but i know whom i have believèd
    and am persuaded that he is able
    to keep that which i have committed
    unto him against that day

i know not how this saving faith
to me he did impart
nor how believing in his word
wrought peace within my heart

i know not how the spirit moves
convincing us of sin
revealing jesus through the word
creating faith in him

i know not what of good or ill
may be reserved for me
of weary ways or golden days
before his face i see

i know not when my lord may come
at night or noonday fair
nor if i walk the vale with him
or meet him in the air
