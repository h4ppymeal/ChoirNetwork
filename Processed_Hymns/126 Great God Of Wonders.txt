great god of wonders
all thy ways are matchless
godlike and divine
but the fair glories of thy grace
more godlike and unrivalled shine

    who is a pardoning god like thee
    or who has grace so rich and free

in wonder lost in trembling joy
we take the pardon of our god
pardon for crimes of deepest dye
a pardon bought with jesus blood

pardon  from an offended god
pardon  for sins of deepest dye
pardon  bestowed throughh jesus blood
pardon  that brings the rebel nigh

o may this strange
this matchless grace
this godlike miracle of love
fill the wide earth with grateful praise
and all the angelic chorus above
