if you have found jesus 
the friend  that you
need if he is loving and true
if you  have found him a saviour indeed
somebody else needs him too

    somebody somewhere perhaps at you side
    somewhere is waiting for you say  that 
    for all jesus suffered and died they needs him 
    they need him too

if you are happy and praise fills your heart
trust him to carry you through 
if he his spirit and love can
impart somebody else needs him too

if you have comfort in being god's child
if he is faithful to you think when you see those whom
sin has defiled somebody else needs him tooo

when the lord gives you his love and grace 
something is he give you to do
you have the gospel  with others to share
somebody needs him too
