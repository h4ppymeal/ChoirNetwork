there is singing up in heaven 
such as we have never known
where the angels sing the praises 
of the lamb upon the throne
their sweet harps are ever tuneful 
and their voices always clear
o that we might be more like them 
while we serve the master here

    holy holy is what the angels sing
    and i expect to help them make the courts of heaven ring
    but when i sing redemption’s story they will fold their wings
    for angels never felt the joys that our salvation brings

but i hear another anthem 
blending voices clear and strong
unto him who hath redeemed us 
and hath bought us is the song
we have come through tribulation 
to this land so fair and bright
in the fountain freely flowing 
he hath made our garments white

then the angels stand and listen 
for they cannot join the song
like the sound of many waters 
by that happy blood washed throng
for they sing about great trials 
battles fought and vict’ries won
and they praise their great redeemer 
who hath said to them well done 

so although i am not an angel 
yet i know that over there
i will join a blessèd chorus 
that the angels cannot share
i will sing about my savior 
who upon dark calvary
freely pardoned my transgressions 
died to set a sinner free
