fading away like the stars of the morning
losing their light in the glorious sun
thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling
only remembered by what we have done

    only remembered only remembered
    only remembered by what we have done
    thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling
    only remembered by what we have done

shall we be missed tho by others succeeded
reaping the fields we in springtime have sown
yes but the sowers must pass from their labours
ever remembered by what they have done

only the truth that in life we have spoken
only the seed that on earth we have sown
these shall pass onward when we are forgotten
fruits of the harvest and what we have done

oh when the saviour shall make up his jewels
when the bright crowns of rejoicing are won
then shall his weary and faithful disciples
all be remembered by what they have done
