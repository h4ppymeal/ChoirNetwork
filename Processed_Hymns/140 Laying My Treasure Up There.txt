on the mountain of zion beyond the blue sky
stands a city so wondrous and fair
i expect to depart for that land by and by
for i am laying my treasure up there

    i am laying my treasure up there up there
    in that beautiful city so fair
    when its glories unfold
    i will have riches untold
    for i am laying my treasure up there

there is a mansion awaiting god's people i am told
which the savior has gone to prepare
there the walls are of jasper the streets are of gold
i am laying my treasure up there

all the love of my heart and my soul mind and strength
and the work that with jesus i share
are but some of the riches i will find there at length
for i am laying my treasure up there

so although' a poor pilgrim on earth i may roam
ever constant in watching and prayer
soon i will hear the glad summons to start for my home
for i am laying my treasure up there
