1 if to christ our only king
men redeemed we strive to bring
just one way this may be done—
we must win them one by one

    so you bring the one next to you
    and i will bring the one next to me
    in all kinds of weather we will all work together
    and see what can be done

if you will bring the one next to you
and i bring the one next to me
in no time at all we will have them all
so win them win them one by one

side by side we stand each day
saved are we but lost are they
they will come if we but dare
speak a word backed up by prayer

only cowards dare refuse
dare this gift of god misuse
ere some friend goes to his grave
speak a word his soul to save

not for hope of great reward
turn men’s hearts unto the lord
just to see a saved man smile
makes the effort well worth while
