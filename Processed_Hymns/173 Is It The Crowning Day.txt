jesus may come today
glad day glad day
and i would see my friend
dangers and troubles would end
if jesus should come today

    glad day glad day
    is it the crowning day
    i’ll live for today nor anxious be
    jesus my lord i soon shall see
    glad day glad day
    is it the crowning day

i may go home today
glad day glad day
seemeth i hear their song
hail to the radiant throng
if i should go home today

why should i anxious be
glad day glad day
lights appear on the shore
storms will affright nevermore
for he is “at hand” today

faithful i’ll be today
glad day glad day
and i will freely tell
why i should love him so well
for he is my all today
