have you any room for jesus
he who bore your load of sin
as he knocks and asks admission
sinner will you let him in

    room for jesus king of glory
    hasten now his word obey
    swing the heart’s door widely open
    bid him enter while you may

room for pleasure room for business
but for christ the crucified
not a place that he can enter
in the heart for which he died 

have you any room for jesus 
soon will pass god's day of grace 
soon thy heart left cold and silent
and thy saviour pleading cease

room and time now give to jesus
soon will pass god’s day of grace 
soon your heart left cold and silent
and your savior’s pleading cease
