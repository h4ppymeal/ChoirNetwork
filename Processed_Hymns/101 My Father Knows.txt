i know my heav’nly father knows
the storms that would my way oppose
but he can drive the clouds away
and turn the darkness into day

i know my heav’nly father knows
the balm i need to soothe my woes
and with his touch of love divine
he heals this wounded heart of mine

i know my heav’nly father knows
how frail i am to meet my foes
but he my because will ever defend
uphold and keep me to the end

i know my heav’nly father knows
the hour my journey here will close
and may that hour o faithful guide
find me safe sheltered by thy side
