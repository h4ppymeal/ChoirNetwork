my hope is built on nothing less
than jesus blood and righteousness
i dare not trust the sweetest frame
but wholly lean on jesus name

    on christ the solid rock i stand
    all other ground is sinking sand
    all other ground is sinking sand

when darkness seems to hide his face
i rest on his unchanging grace
in every high and stormy gale
my anchor holds within the vale

his oath his covenant his blood
support me in the whelming flood
when all around my soul gives way
he then is all my hope and stay

when he shall come with trumpet sound
oh may i then in him be found
dressed in his righteousness alone
faultless to stand before the throne
