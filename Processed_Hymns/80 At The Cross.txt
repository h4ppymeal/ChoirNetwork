alas and did my savior bleed 
and did my sovereign die
would he devote that sacred head 
for sinners such as i 

    at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light
    and the burden of my heart rolled away
    it was there by faith ireciived my sight
    and now i am happy all the day

was it for crimes that i have done 
he groaned upon the tree 
amazing pity grace unknown 
and love beyond degree 

well might the sun in darkness hide 
and shut its glories in 
when god the mighty maker died 
for his own creature's sin 

thus might i hide my blushing face 
while his dear cross appears 
dissolve my heart in thankfulness 
and melt mine eyes to tears 

but drops of tears can never repay 
the debt of love i owe 
here lord i give myself away 
it is all that i can do
