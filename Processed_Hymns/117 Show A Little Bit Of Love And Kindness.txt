sing a song spread some cheer
there are sad and lonely people evrywhere
be a friend show some love
it will lift them from the dungeons of despair

    show a little bit of love and kindness
    never go along with hatreds blindness
    take a little time to reach for joy and wear a happy face
    sing a little bit when the days are dreary
    give a little help to a friend whos weary 
    thats the way to make the world a happy place

offer help bring some hope
to the fainting and discouraged on lifes road
see a need lend a hand
there are many who are crushed beneath their load

be a light show the way
be a light within the night for those astray
speak a word loving word
that will bring them back to walk the narrow way
