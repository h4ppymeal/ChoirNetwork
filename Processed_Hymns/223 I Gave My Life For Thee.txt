i gave my life for thee
my precious blood i shed
that thou mightst ransomed be
and quickened from the dead
i gave i gave my life for thee – 
what hast thou givn for me

my fathers house of light
my glorycircled throne
i left for earthly night
for wandrings sad and lone
i left i left it all for thee –
hast thou left aught for me

i suffered much for thee
more than thy tongue can tell
of bittrest agony
to rescue thee from hell
ive borne ive borne it all for thee –
what hast thou borne for me

and i have brought to thee
down from my home above
salvation full and free
my pardon and my love
i bring i bring rich gifts to thee –
what hast thou brought to me
