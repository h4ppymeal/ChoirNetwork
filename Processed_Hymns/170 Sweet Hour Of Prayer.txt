sweet hour of prayr sweet hour of prayr
that calls me from a world of care
and bids me at my fathers throne
make all my wants and wishes known
in seasons of distress and grief
my soul has often found relief
and oft escaped the tempters snare
by thy return sweet hour of prayr

sweet hour of prayr sweet hour of prayr
thy wings shall my petition bear
to him whose truth and faithfulness
engage the waiting soul to bless
and since he bids me seek his face
believe his word and trust his grace
ill cast on him my every care
and wait for thee sweet hour of prayr

sweet hour of prayr sweet hour of prayr
may i thy consolation share
till from mount pisgahs lofty height
i view my home and take my flight
this robe of flesh ill drop and rise
to seize the everlasting prize
and shout while passing through the air
farewell farewell sweet hour of prayr
