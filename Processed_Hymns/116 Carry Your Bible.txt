carry your bible with you
let all its blessings outflow
it will supply you each moment
take it wherever you go

    take it wherever you go
    take it wherever you go
    god’s message of love
    sent down from above
    o take it wherever you go

carry the word of pardon
sweeter each day it will grow
somewhere some heart will be waiting
take it wherever you go

carry the wondrous story
tell it to hearts plunged in woe
this word of gracious redemption
take it wherever you go 

carry the word of promise
sinners unpardoned may know
god’s path from sin unto safety
take it wherever you go
