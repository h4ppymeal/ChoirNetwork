1 i do not ask to see the way
my feet will have to tread
but only that my soul may feed
upon the living bread
tis better far that i should walk
by faith close to his side 
i may not know the way i go
but oh i know my guide 

    his love can never fail
    his love can never fail
    my soul is satisfied to know
    his love can never fail

2 and if my feet would go astray
they cannot for i know
that jesus guides my faltring steps
as joyfully i go
and tho i may not see his face
my faith is strong and clear
that in each hour of sore distress
my savior will be near

3 i will not fear tho darkness come
abroad oer all the land
if i may only feel the touch
of his own loving hand
and tho i tremble when i think
how weak i am how frail
my soul is satisfied to know
his love can never fail
