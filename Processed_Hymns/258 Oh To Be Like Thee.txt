oh to be like thee blessed redeemer
this is my constant longing and prayer
gladly i will forfeit all of earth's treasures
jesus thy perfect likeness to wear

    oh to be like thee oh to be like thee
    blessed redeemer pure as thou art
    come in thy sweetness come in thy fulness
    stamp thine own image deep on my heart

o to be like thee full of compassion
loving forgiving tender and kind
helping the helpless cheering the fainting
seeking the wand'ring sinner to find

oh to be like thee lowly in spirit
holy and harmless patient and brave
meekly enduring cruel reproaches
willing to suffer others to save

oh to be like thee lord i am coming
now to receive th' anointing divine
all that i am and have i am bringing
lord from this moment all shall be thine

oh to be like thee while i am pleading
pour out thy spirit fill with thy love
make me a temple meet for thy dwelling
fit me for life and heaven above
