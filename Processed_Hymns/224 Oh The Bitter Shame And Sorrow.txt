o the bitter shame and sorrow
that a time could ever be
when i let the savior’s pity
plead in vain and proudly answered
all of self and none of thee

yet he found me i beheld him
bleeding on th’accursèd tree
heard him pray forgive them father
and my wistful heart said faintly
some of self and some of thee

day by day his tender mercy
healing helping full and free
sweet and strong and ah so patient
brought me lower while i whispered
less of self and more of thee

higher than the highest heavens
deeper than the deepest sea
lord thy love at last hath conquered
grant me now my supplication
none of self and all of thee
