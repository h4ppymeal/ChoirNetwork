there is urgent work for all
heed the spirit’s interceding
give this answer to the call

    i am ready for the service for thee dear lord
    here am i send me
    i am willing to be what you’d have me be
    i will go where you want me to go
    i am ready for service for thee dear lord
    here am i send me
    tho’ the pathway seems dark for thee i’ll do or die
    i am ready for service lord

there’s a voice to you now calling
will you heed the earnest word
on the ear ‘tis gently falling
give this answer to your lord

many souls in sin are dying
haste to help them while you may
for the time is swiftly flying
