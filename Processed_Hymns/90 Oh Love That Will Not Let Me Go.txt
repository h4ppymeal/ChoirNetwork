o love that wilt not let me go
i rest my weary soul in thee
i give thee back the life i owe
that in thine ocean depths its flow
may richer fuller be

o light that foll’west all my way
i yield my flick’ring torch to thee
my heart restores its borrowed ray
that in thy sunshine’s blaze its day
may brighter fairer be

o joy that seekest me through pain
i cannot close my heart to thee
i trace the rainbow through the rain
and feel the promise is not vain
that morn shall tearless be

o cross that liftest up my head
i dare not ask to fly from thee
i lay in dust life’s glory dead
and from the ground there blossoms red
life that shall endless be
