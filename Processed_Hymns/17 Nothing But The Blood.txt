what can wash away my sin
nothing but the blood of jesus
what can make me whole again
nothing but the blood of jesus

    oh precious is the flow
    that makes me white as snow
    no other fount i know
    nothing but the blood of jesus

for my pardon this i see
nothing but the blood of jesus
for my cleansing this my plea
nothing but the blood of jesus

nothing can for sin atone
nothing but the blood of jesus
naught of good that i have done
nothing but the blood of jesus

this is all my hope and peace
nothing but the blood of jesus
this is all my righteousness
nothing but the blood of jesus

now by this i will overcome—
nothing but the blood of jesus
now by this i will reach my home—
nothing but the blood of jesus

glory glory this i sing—
nothing but the blood of jesus
all my praise for this i bring—
nothing but the blood of jesus
