i dreamed that the great judgment morning
had dawned and the trumpet had blown
i dreamed that the nations had gathered
to judgment before the white throne
from the throne came a bright shining angel
and stood on the land and the sea
and swore with his hand raised to heaven
that time was no longer to be

    and o what a weeping and wailing
    as the lost were told of their fate
    they cried for the rocks and the mountains
    they prayed but their prayer was too late

the rich man was there but his money
had melted and vanished away
a pauper he stood in the judgment
his debts were too heavy to pay
the great man was there but his greatness
when death came was left far behind
the angel that opened the records
not a trace of his greatness could find

the widow was there with the orphans
god heard and remembered their cries
no sorrow in heaven for ever
god wiped all the tears from their eyes
the gambler was there and the drunkard
and the man that had sold them the drink
with the people who gave him the license
together in hell they did sink

the moral man came to the judgment
but his selfrighteous rags would not do
the men who had crucified jesus
had passed off as moral men too
the soul that had put off salvation
not tonight i will get saved by and by
no time now to think of religion
at last they had found time to die
