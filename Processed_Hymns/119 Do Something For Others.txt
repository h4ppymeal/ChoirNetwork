many a soul in the battle of life
trembles with fear at the din and the strife
bearing alone amid trial and care
burdens and sorrows god bids you to share

    do something for others
    something for others today
    duty demands it
    and jesus commands it
    do something for others today

many in doubt or in fear of the way
mutely appeal for your guidance today
on your demeanor the choice may depend—
are you concerned for the stranger or friend 

many disheartened by cruel deceit
broken and worn by the pangs of defeat
doubting despairingly helplessly stand
waiting perhaps for your strengthening hand

many are turning away from the right
into the maze of the shadows of night
go to them speak to them over them pray
help them support them—do something today refrain
