1 what a friend we have in jesus
all our sins and griefs to bear
what a privilege to carry 
evrything to god in prayer
oh what peace we often forfeit
oh what needless pain we bear 
all because we do not carry
evrything to god in prayer

2 have we trials and temptations
is there trouble anywhere
we should never be discouraged
take it to the lord in prayer
can we find a friend so faithful
who will all our sorrows share
jesus knows our every weakness
take it to the lord in prayer

3 are we weak and heavy laden
cumbered with a load of care
precious saviour still our refuge  
take it to the lord in prayer
do thy friends despise forsake thee
take it to the lord in prayer
