praise him praise him jesus our blessed redeemer
sing o earth his wonderful love proclaim
hail him hail him highest archangels in glory
strength and honour give to his holy name
like a shepherd jesus will guard his children
in his arms he carries them all day long
o ye saints that dwell on the mountain of zion
praise him praise him ever in joyful song

praise him praise him jesus our blessed redeemer
for our sins he sufferd and bled and died
he our rock our hope of eternal salvation 
hail him hail him jesus the crucified
loving saviour meekly enduring sorrow
crownd with thorns that cruelly piercd his brow
once for us rejected despisd and forsaken
prince of glory ever triumphant now

praise him praise him jesus our blessed redeemer
heavnly portals loud with hosannas ring
jesus saviour reigneth forever and ever
crown him crown him prophet and priest and king
death is vanquished tell it with joy ye faithful
where is now thy victory boasting grave
jesus lives no longer thy portals are cheerless
jesus lives the mighty and strong to save
