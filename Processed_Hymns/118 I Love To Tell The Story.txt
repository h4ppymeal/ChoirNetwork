i love to tell the story 
of unseen things above
of jesus and his glory 
of jesus and his love
i love to tell the story 
because i know it is true
it satisfies my longings 
as nothing else could do

    i love to tell the story 
    'twill be my theme in glory
    to tell the old old story 
    of jesus and his love

i love to tell the story 
more wonderful it seems
than all the golden fancies 
of all our golden dreams
i love to tell the story 
it did so much for me
and that is just the reason 
i tell it now to thee

i love to tell the story 
it is pleasant to repeat
what seems each time i tell it 
more wonderfully sweet
i love to tell the story 
for some have never heard
the message of salvation 
from god's own holy word 

i love to tell the story 
for those who know it best
seem hungering and thirsting 
to hear it like the rest
and when in scenes of glory 
i sing the new new song
'twill be the old old story
that i have loved so long
