rejoice in the lord oh let his mercy cheer 
he sunders the bands that enthral
redeemd by his blood why should we ever fear 
since jesus is our all in all

    if god be for us if god be for us
    if god be for us who can be against us 
    who who who
    who can be against us against us

be strong in the lord rejoicing in his might
be loyal and true day by day 
when evils assail be valiant for the right 
and he will be our strength and stay

confide in his word  his promises so sure
in christ they are yea and amen
though earth pass away they ever shall endure
tis written oer and oer again

abide in the lord secure in his control 
tis life everlasting begun 
to pluck from his hand the weakest trembling soul 
it never never can be done
