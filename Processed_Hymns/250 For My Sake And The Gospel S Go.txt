for my sake and the gospels go
and tell redemptions story
his heralds answer be it so
and thine lord all the glory
they preach his birth his life his cross
the love of his atonement
for whom they count the world but loss
his easter his enthronement 

hark hark the trump of jubilee
proclaims to every nation
from pole to pole by land and sea
glad tidings of salvation
still on and on the anthems spread
of alleluia voices
in concert with the holy dead
the warrior church rejoices

still on and on the anthems spread
of alleluia voices
in concert with the holy dead
the warrior church rejoices
their snow white robes are washed in blood
their golden harps are ringing
earth and the paradise of god
one triumph song are singing

he comes whose advent trumpet drowns
the last of times evangels
immanuel crowned with many crowns
the lord of saints and angels
o life light love the great i am
triune who changest never
the throne of god and of the lamb
is thine and thine for ever
