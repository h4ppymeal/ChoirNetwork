on a hill far away stood the old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain

    so i will cherish the old rugged cross
    till my trophies at last i lay down
    i will cling to the old rugged cross
    and exchange some day for a crown

o that old rugged cross so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary

in the old rugged cross stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for it was on that old cross jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me

to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
its shame and reproach gladly bear
then he will call me some day to my home far away
where his glory for ever i will share
