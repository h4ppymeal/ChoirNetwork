my faith has found a resting place
not in device nor creed
i trust the ever living one
his wounds for me shall plead

    i need no other argument
    i need no other plea
    it is enough that jesus died
    and that he died for me

enough for me that jesus saves
this ends my fear and doubt
a sinful soul i come to him
hell never cast me out

my heart is leaning on the word
the written word of god
salvation by my saviours name
salvation through his blood

my great physician heals the sick
the lost he came to save
for me his precious blood he shed
for me his life he gave
