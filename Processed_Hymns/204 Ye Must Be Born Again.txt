a ruler once came to jesus by night
to ask him the way of salvation and light
the master made answer in words true and plain
ye must be born again
ye must be born again
ye must be born again
i verily verily say unto thee
ye must be born again

    ye must be born again
    ye must be born again
    i verily verily say unto thee
    ye must be born again

ye children of men attend to the word
so solemnly uttered by jesus the lord
and let not this message to you be in vain
ye must be born again
ye must be born again
ye must be born again
i verily verily say unto thee
ye must be born again

o ye who would enter that glorious rest
and sing with the ransomed the song of the blest
the life everlasting if ye would obtain
ye must be born again
ye must be born again
ye must be born again
i verily verily say unto thee
ye must be born again

a dear one in heaven thy heart yearns to see
at the beautiful gate may be watching for thee
then list to the note of this solemn refrain
ye must be born again
