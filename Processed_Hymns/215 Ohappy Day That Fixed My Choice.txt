o happy day that fixed my choice
on thee my saviour and my god
well may this glowing heart rejoice
and tell its raptures all abroad

happy day happy day
when jesus washed my sins away
he taught me how to watch and pray
and live rejoicing every day
happy day happy day
when jesus washed my sins away

o happy bond that seals my vows
to him who merits all my love
let cheerful anthems fill his house
while to that sacred shrine i move

tis done the great transactions done
i am the lords and he is mine
he drew me and i followed on
charmed to confess the voice divine

now rest my long divided heart
fixed on this blissful centre rest
here have i found a nobler part
here heavenly pleasures fill my breast

high heaven that heard the solemn vow
that vow renewed shall daily hear
till in lifes latest hour i bow
and bless in death a bond so dear
