ill tell the world that im a christian â€“
im not ashamed his name to bear
ill tell the world that im a christian
ill take him with me anywhere
ill tell the world how jesus saved me
and how he gave me a life brandnew
and i know that if you trust him
that all he gave me hell give to you
ill tell the world that hes my saviour
no other one could love me so
my life my all is his for ever
and where he leads me i will go

ill tell the world that he is coming
it may be near or far away
but we must live as if his coming
shall be tomorrow or today
for when he comes and life is over
for those who love him theres more to be
eyes have never seen the wonders
that hes preparing for you and me
o tell the world that youre a christian
be not ashamed his name to bear
o tell the world that youre a christian
and take him with you evrywhere
