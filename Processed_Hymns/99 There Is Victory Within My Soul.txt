there is vict’ry within my soul
for the spirit with me abides
let the waves of temptation roll
jesus keeps me whate’er betides

    victory victory vict’ry in my soul
    i have glorious victory
    since jesus took control
    victory victory sweeping like a flood
    i have glorious victory thro’ jesus’ blood

though’ the conflict be fierce and long
though’ the tempter my heart assail
in my weakness yet i am strong
for with jesus i will ever prevail

i have victory over sin
i have victory over grave
even death now has lost its sting
halleluyah i know i am saved
