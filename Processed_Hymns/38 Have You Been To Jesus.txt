have you been to jesus for the cleansing power
are you washed in the blood of the lamb
are you fully trusting in his grace this hour
are you washed in the blood of the lamb

    are you washed in the blood
    in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb
    are your garments spotless
    are they white as snow
    are you washed in the blood of the lamb

are you walking daily by the savior's side
are you washed in the blood of the lamb
do you rest each moment in the crucified

when the bridegroom cometh will your robes be white
are you washed in the blood of the lamb
will your soul be ready for the mansions bright
and be washed in the blood of the lamb

lay aside the garments that are stained with sin
and be washed in the blood of the lamb
there is a fountain flowing for the soul unclean
o be washed in the blood of the lamb
