blest be the tie that binds
our hearts in christian love
the fellowship of kindred minds
is like to that above

before our fathers throne
we pour our ardent prayers
our fears our hopes our aims are one
our comforts and our cares

we share our mutual woes
our mutual burdens bear
and often for each other flows
the sympathising tear

when we asunder part
it gives us inward pain
but we shall still be joined in heart
and hope to meet again

this glorious hope revives
our courage by the way
while each in expectation lives
and longs to see the day

from sorrow toil and pain
and sin we shall be free
and perfect love and friendship reign
through all eternity
