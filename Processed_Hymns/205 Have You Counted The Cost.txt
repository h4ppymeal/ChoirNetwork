theres a line that is drawn by rejecting our lord
where the call of his spirit is lost …
and you hurry along with the pleasuremad throng –
have you counted have you counted the cost

    have you counted the cost if your soul should be lost
    though you gain the whole world for your own
    even now it may be that the line you have crossed
    have you counted have you counted the cost

you may barter your hope of eternitys morn
for a moment of joy at the most …
for the glitter of sin and the things it will win –
have you counted have you counted the cost

while the door of his mercy is open to you
ere the depth of his love you exhaust …
wont you come and be healed wont you whisper i yield –
i have counted i have counted the cost
