take time to be holy speak of with thy lord
abide in him always and feed on his word
make friends of gods children help those who are weak
forgetting in nothing his blessing to seek

take time to be holy the world rushes on
spend much time in secret with jesus alone –
by looking to jesus like him thou shalt be
thy friends in thy conduct his likeness shall see

take time to be holy let him be thy guide
and run not before him whatever betide
in joy or in sorrow still follow thy lord
and looking to jesus still trust in his word

take time to be holy be calm in thy soul
each thought and each temper beneath his control
thus led by his spirit to fountains of love
thou soon shalt be fitted for service above
