there’s no one like my saviour
no friend can be like him
my never failing sunshine
when earthly lights grow dim
when summer flowrs are blooming
the brightness of my joy
o may his happy service
my heart and life employ

    no one no one like my precious saviour
    no one no such a friend can be
    no one no one like my precious saviour
    glory glory jesus cares for me

there’s no one like my saviour
in seasons of distress
he draws me closer to him
to comfort and to bless
he gives me in temptation
the strength of his right arm
his angels camp around me
to keep me from all harm 

there’s no one like my saviour
he pardons all my sin
and gives his holy spirit
a springing well within
he leads me out to service
with gentle touch and mild
o wonder of all wonders
that i should be his child

there’s no one like my saviour
come now and find it true
he gave his life a ransom
his blood was shed for you
then when we reach the city
of everlasting light
we’ll sing with saints and angels
all honour powr and might
