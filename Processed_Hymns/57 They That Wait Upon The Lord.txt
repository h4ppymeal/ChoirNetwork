ho reapers in the whitened harvest
oft feeble faint and few
come wait upon the blessed master
our strength he will renew

    for “they that wait upon the lord
    shall renew their strength
    they shall mount up with wings
    they shall mount up with wings as eagles
    they shall run and not be weary
    they shall walk and not faint
    they shall run and not be weary
    they shall walk and not faint
    they shall run and not be weary
    shall walk and not faint”

too oft aweary and discouraged
we pour a sad complaint
believing in a living saviour
why should we ever faint

rejoice for he is with us alway
lo even to the end
look up take courage and go forward
all needed grace he will send
