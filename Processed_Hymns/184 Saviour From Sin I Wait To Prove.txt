saviour from sin i wait to prove
that jesus is thy healing name
to lose when perfected in love
whateer i have or can or am
i stay me on thy faithful word
the servant shall be as his lord 

answer that gracious end in me
for which thy precious life was given
redeem from all iniquity
restore and make me meet for heaven
unless thou purge my every stain
thy suffering and my faith are vain 

didst thou not in the flesh appear
sin to condemn and man to save
that perfect love might cast out fear
that i thy mind in me might have
in holiness show forth thy praise
and serve thee all my spotless days 

didst thou not die that i might live
no longer to myself but thee
might body soul and spirit give
to him who gave himself for me
come then my master and my god
take the dear purchase of thy blood 

thy own peculiar servant claim
for thy own truth and mercys sake
hallow in me thy glorious name
me for thine own this moment take
and change and throughly purify
thine only may i live and die
