there shall be showers of blessing
this is the promise of love
there shall be seasons refreshing
sent from the saviour above

    showers of blessing
    showers of blessing we need
    mercy drops round us are falling
    but for the showers we plead 

there shall be showers of blessing â€“
precious reviving again
over the hills and the valleys
sound of abundance of rain

there shall be showers of blessing
send them upon us o lord
grant to us now a refreshing
come and now honour thy word

there shall be showers of blessing
oh that today they might fall
now as to god were confessing
now as on jesus we call

there shall be showers of blessing
if we but trust and obey
there shall be seasons refreshing
if we let god have his way
