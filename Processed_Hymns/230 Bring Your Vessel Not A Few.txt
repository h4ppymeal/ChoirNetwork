are you longing for the fullness
of the blessing of the lord
in your heart and life today
claim the promise of your father
come according to his word
in the blessèd old time way

    he will fill your heart today to overflowing
    as the lord commandeth you
    “bring your vessels not a few
    he will fill your heart today to overflowing
    with the holy ghost and power

bring your empty earthen vessels
clean through jesus’ precious blood
come ye needy one and all
and in human consecration
wait before the throne of god
till the holy ghost shall fall

like the cruse of oil unfailing
is his grace forevermore
and his love unchanging still
and according to his promise
with the holy ghost and power
he will every vessel fill
