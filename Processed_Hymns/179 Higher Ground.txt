im pressing on the upward way
new heights im gaining everyday
still praying as i onward bound
lord plant my feet on higher ground

    lord lift me up and let me stand
    by faith on heavens table land
    a higher plane than i have found
    lord plant my feet on higher ground

my heart has no desire to stay
where doubts arise and fears dismay
tho some may dwell where these abound
my prayr my aim is higher ground

i want to live above the world
though satans darts at me are hurled
but still ill pray till heavn ive found
lord lead me on to higher ground

i want to scale the utmost height
and catch a gleam of glory bright
for faith has caught the joyful sound
the song of saints on higher ground
