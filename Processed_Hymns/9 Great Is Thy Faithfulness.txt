great is thy faithfulness o god my father
there is no shadow of turning with thee
thou changest not thy compassions they fail not
as thou hast been thou for ever wilt be

    great is thy faithfulness great is thy faithfulness
    morning by morning new mercies i see
    all i have needed thy hand hath provided
    great is thy faithfulness lord unto me

summer and winter and springtime and harvest
sun moon and stars in their courses above
join with all nature in manifold witness
to thy great faithfulness mercy and love

pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide
strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
blessings all mine with ten thousand beside
