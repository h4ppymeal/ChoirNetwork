speed thy servants saviour speed them 
thou art lord of winds and waves 
they were bound but thou hast freed them 
now they go to free the slaves 
be thou with them tis thine arm alone that save 
tis thine arm alone that saves 

friends and home and all forsaking 
lord they go at thy command 
as their stay thy promise taking 
while they traverse sea and land 
o be with them 
lead them safely by the hand
o be with them 
lead them safely by the hand

where no fruit appears to cheer them 
and they seem to toil in vain 
then in mercy lord draw near them 
then their sinking hopes sustain 
thus supported 
let their zeal revive again 
thus supported 
let their zeal revive again 

in the midst of opposition 
let them trust o lord in thee 
when success attends their mission 
let thy servants humbler be 
never leave them 
till thy face in heavn they see 
never leave them 
till thy face in heavn they see 

there to reap in joy forever 
fruit that grows from seed here sown 
there to be with him who never ceases to preserve his
own and with gladness give the praise to him alone
