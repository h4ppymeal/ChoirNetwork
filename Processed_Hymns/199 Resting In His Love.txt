god has shown his loving face
from his throne in heav'n above
and i have found a restingplace
in the shelter of his love

    i am resting resting
    resting in his love i am resting in his love
    resting in the shelter of his love

what the care of his life oppress 
when the sky is dark above
i can always find rest 
in the shelter of his love

o if you were never blest
with this peace from heaven above
there is for you a wonderous rest 
in the shelter of his love
