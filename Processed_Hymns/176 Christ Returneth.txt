it may be at morn when the day is awaking
when sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking
that jesus will come in the fullness of glory
to receive from the world his own

    o lord jesus how long how long
    ere we shout the glad song
    christ returneth 
    hallelujah hallelujah 
    amen hallelujah amen

it may be at midday it may be at twilight
it may be perchance that the blackness of midnight
will burst into light in the blaze of his glory
when jesus receives his own

while its hosts cry hosanna from heaven descending
with glorified saints and the angels attending
with grace on his brow like a halo of glory
will jesus receive his own

o joy o delight should we go without dying
no sickness no sadness no dread and no crying
caught up through the clouds with our lord into glory
when jesus receives his own
