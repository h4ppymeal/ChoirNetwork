marvelous message we bring
glorious carol we sing
wonderful word of the king
jesus is coming again

    coming again coming again
    maybe morning maybe noon
    maybe evening and maybe soon
    coming again coming again
    oh what a wonderful day it will be
    jesus is coming again

forest and flower exclaim
mountain and meadow the same
all earth and heaven proclaim
jesus is coming again

standing before him at last
trial and trouble all past
crowns at his feet we will cast
jesus is coming again
