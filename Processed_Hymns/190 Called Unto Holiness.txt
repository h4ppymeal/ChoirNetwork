called unto holiness church of our god
purchased of jesus redeemed by his blood
called from the world and its idols to flee
called from the bondage of sin to be free

    holiness unto the lord is our watchword and song
    holiness unto the lord as were marching along
    sing    it shout it loud    and long
    holiness unto the lord now and for ever

called unto holiness children of light
walking with jesus in garments of white
raiment unsullied nor tarnished with sin
gods holy spirit abiding within

called unto holiness praise his dear name
this blessed secret to faith now made plain
not our own righteousness but christ within
living and reigning and saving from sin

called unto holiness glorious thought
up from the wilderness wanderings brought
out from the shadows and darkness of night
into the canaan of perfect delight

called unto holiness bride of the lamb
waiting the bridegrooms returning again
lift up your heads for the day draweth near
when in his beauty the king shall appear
