sing the wondrous love of jesus
sing his mercy and his grace
in the mansions bright and blessed
hell prepare for us a place

    when we all get to heaven
    what a day of rejoicing that will be
    when we all see jesus
    well sing and shout the victory

while we walk the pilgrim pathway
clouds will overspread the sky
but when travling days are over
not a shadow not a sigh

let us then be true and faithful
trusting serving evry day
just one glimpse of him in glory
will the toils of life repay

onward to the prize before us
soon his beauty well behold
soon the pearly gates will open
we shall tread the streets of gold
