shackled by a heavy burden
'neath a load of guilt and shame
then the hand of jesus touched me
and now i am no longer the same

    he touched me oh he touched me
    and oh the joy that floods my soul
    something happened and now i know
    he touched me and made me whole

since i met this blessed savior
since he cleansed and made me whole
i will never cease to praise him
i will shout it while eternity rolls
