1 “i am the way” the saviour said
and i would follow on
content to know that after night
shall break a glorious dawn

    “i am the way the truth and the life
    no man cometh unto the father but by me”
    “i am the way the truth and the life
    no man cometh unto the father but by me”

“i am the truth” then truth shall be
a beacon light to guide
my bark across the stormy sea
to where still waters glide

“i am the life” there is no death
for me to fear nor dread
since by his allatoning blood
my life to his is wed
