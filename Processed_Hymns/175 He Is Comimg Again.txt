lift up your heads pilgrims aweary
see day’s approach now crimson the sky
night shadows flee and your belovèd
awaited with longing at last draweth nigh

    he is coming again he is coming again
    the very same jesus rejected of men
    he is coming again he is coming again
    with powr and great glory he is coming again

dark was the night sin warred against us
heavy the load of sorrow we bore
but now we see signs of his coming
our hearts glow within us joy’s cup runneth o’er

o blessèd hope o blissful promise
filling our hearts with rapture divine
o day of days hail thy appearing
thy transcendent glory forever shall shine

even so come precious lord jesus
creation waits redemption to see
caught up in clouds soon we shall meet thee
o blessèd assurance forever with thee
