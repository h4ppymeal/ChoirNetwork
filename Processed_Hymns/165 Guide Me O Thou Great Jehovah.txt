guide me o thou great jehovah
pilgrim thro this barren land
i am weak but thou art mighty
hold me by thy powrful hand
bread of heaven bread of heaven
feed me now and ever more
feed me now and ever more

open now thou crystal fountain
whence the healing stream doth flow
let the fiery cloudy pillar
lead me all my journey through
strong deliverer strong deliverer
be thou still my strength and shield
be thou still my strength and shield

if i tread the verge of jordan
bid my anxious fears subside
bear me through the swelling torrent
land me safe on canaans side
songs of praises songs of praises
i will ever give to thee
i will ever give to thee

saviour come we long to see thee
long to dwell with thee above
and to know in full communion
all the sweetness of thy love
come lord jesus come lord jesus
take thy waiting people home
take thy waiting people home
