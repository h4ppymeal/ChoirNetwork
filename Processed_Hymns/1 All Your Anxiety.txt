is there a heart overbound by sorrow
is there a life weighed down by care
come to the cross each burden bearing
all your anxiety leave it there

    all your anxiety all your care
    bring to the mercy seat leave it there
    never a burden he cannot bear
    never a friend like jesus

no other friend so keen to help you
no other friend so quick to hear
no other place to leave your burden
no other one to hear your prayer

come then at once delay no longer
heed his entreaty kind and sweet
you need not fear a disappointment 
you shall find peace at the mercy seat
