must i go and emptyhanded
thus my dear redeemer meet
not one day of service give him
lay no trophy at his feet

    must i go and emptyhanded
    must i meet my saviour so
    not one soul with which to greet him
    must i emptyhanded go

not at death i shrink nor falter
for my saviour saves me now
but to meet him emptyhanded
thought of that now clouds my brow

o the years in sinning wasted
could i but recall them now
i would give them to my saviour
to his will i would gladly bow

o ye saints arouse be earnest
up and work while yet it is day
ere the night of death o'ertake thee
strive for souls while still you may
