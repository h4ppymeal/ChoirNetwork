jesus shall reign where'er sun successive journeys run kingdom stretch shore shore till moons shall wax wane shall endless prayer made praises throng crown head name like sweet perfume shall rise every morning sacrifice people realms every tongue dwell love sweetest song infant voices shall proclaim early blessings name blessings abound where'er reigns prisoners leap lose chains weary find eternal rest suffer want blest let every creature rise bring highest honors king angels descend songs earth repeat loud amen
