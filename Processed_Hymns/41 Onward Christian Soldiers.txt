onward christian soldiers marching as to war
with the cross of jesus going on before
christ the royal master leads against the foe
forward into battle see his banners go

    onward christian soldiers
    marching as to war
    with the cross of jesus
    going on before

like a mighty army moves the church of god
brothers we are treading where the saints have trod
we are not divided all one body we
one in hope and doctrine one in charity

crowns and thrones may perish kingdoms rise and wane
but the church of jesus constant will remain
gates of hell can never gainst that church prevail
we have christs own promise which can never fail

onward then ye people join our happy throng
blend with ours your voices in the triumph song
glory laud and honour unto christ the king
this thro countless ages men and angels sing
