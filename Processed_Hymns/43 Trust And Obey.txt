when we walk with the lord
in the light of his word
what a glory he sheds on our way
while we do his good will
he abides with us still
and with all who will trust and obey

    trust and obey for there is no other way
    to be happy in jesus
    but to trust and obey

not a shadow can rise
not a cloud in the skies
but his smile quickly drives it away
not a doubt or a fear
not a sight nor a tear
can abide while we trust and obey

not a burden we bear
not a sorrow we share
but our toil he doth richly repay
not a grief nor a loss
not a frown nor a cross
but is blest if we trust and obey

but we never can prove
the delights of his love
until all on the altar we lay
for the favour he shows
and the joy he bestows
are for them who will trust and obey

then in fellowship sweet
we will sit at his feet
or we will walk by his side in the way
what he says we will do
where he leads we will go
never fear only trust and obey
