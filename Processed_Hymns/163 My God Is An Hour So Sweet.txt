my god is any hour so sweet
from blush of morn to evening star
as that which calls me to thy feet
the hour of prayer

then is my strength by thee renewed
then are my sins by thee forgiv’n
then dost thou cheer my solitude
with hopes of heav’n

no words can tell what sweet relief
there for my evry want i find
what strength for warfare balm for grief
what peace of mind

hushed is each doubt gone evry fear
my spirit seems in heav’n to stay
and e’en the penitential tear
is wiped away

lord till i reach yon blissful shore
no privilege so dear shall be
as thus my inmost soul to pour
in prayer to thee
