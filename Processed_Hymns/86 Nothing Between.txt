nothing between my soul and my savior
naught of this world’s delusive dream
i have renounced all sinful pleasure
jesus is mine there is nothing between

nothing between like worldly pleasure
habits of life though harmless they seem
must not my heart from him ever sever
he is my all there is nothing between

nothing between like pride or station
self or friends shall not intervene
though it may cost me much tribulation
i am resolved there is nothing between

nothing between e’en many hard trials
though the whole world against me convene
watching with prayer and much self denial
i will triumph at last there is nothing between
