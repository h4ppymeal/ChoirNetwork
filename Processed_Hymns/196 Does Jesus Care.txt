does jesus care when my heart is pained
too deeply for mirth or song
as the burdens press and the cares distress
and the way grows weary and long

    o yes he cares i know he cares
    his heart is touched with my grief
    when the days are weary
    the long night dreary
    i know my saviour cares

does jesus care when my way is dark
with a nameless dread and fear
as the daylight fades into deep night shades
does he care enough to be near

does jesus care when ive tried and failed
to resist some temptation strong
when for my deep grief there is no relief
though my tears flow all the night long

does jesus care when ive said goodbye
to the dearest on earth to me
and my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks
is it aught to him does he care
