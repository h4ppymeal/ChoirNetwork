there is no love like the love of jesus
never to fail or fall
till into the fold of the peace of god
he has gathered us all

    jesus love precious love
    boundless and pure and free
    oh turn to that love weary wandring soul
    jesus pleadeth for thee

there is no eye like the eye of jesus
piercing so fa away neer out of the sight of  its tender
light can wanderer stray

there is no voice like the voice of jesus
tender and sweet its chime 
like musical ring of a flowing spring 
in the bright summertime

4 there is no heart like the heart of jesus
filld with a tender love
no throb of woe that our hearts can know
but he feeds it above
