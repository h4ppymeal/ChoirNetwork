christ our mighty captain leads against the foe
we will never falter when he bids us go
tho his righteous purpose we may never know
yet well follow all the way

    forward forward tis the lords command
    forward forward to the promised land
    forward forward let the chorus ring
    we are sure to win with christ our king

satans fearful onslaught cannot make us yield
while we trust in christ our buckler and our shield
pressing ever on the spirits sword we weild
and follow all the way

let our glorious banner ever be unfurled
from its mighty stronghold evil shall be hurled
christ our mighty captain overcomes the world
and we follow all the way 

fierce the battle rages but twill not be long
then triumphant shall we join the blessed throng
joyfully uniting in the victors song
if we follow all the way
