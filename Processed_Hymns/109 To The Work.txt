to the work to the work we are servants of god
let us follow the path that our master has trod
with the balm of his counsel our strength to renew
let us do with our might what our hands find to do

    toiling on toiling on
    toiling on toiling on
    let us hope let us watch
    and labor till the master comes

to the work to the work let the hungry be fed
to the fountain of life let the weary be led
in the cross and its banner our glory shall be
while we herald the tidings salvation is free

to the work to the work there is labor for all
for the kingdom of darkness and error shall fall
and the name of jehovah exalted shall be
in the loud swelling chorus salvation is free 

to the work to the work in the strength of the lord
and a robe and a crown shall our labor reward
when the home of the faithful our dwelling shall be
and we shout with the ransomed salvation is free
