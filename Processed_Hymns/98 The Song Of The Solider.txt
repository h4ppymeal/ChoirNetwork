rise ye children of salvation
all who cleave to christ the head
wake arise o mighty nation
ere the foe on zion tread

    pour it forth a mighty anthem
    pour it forth a mighty anthem
    like the thunders of the sea
    through the blood of christ our ransom
    more than conquerors are we
    more than conquerors are we
    more than conquerors are we
    through the blood of christ our ransom
    more than conquerors are we

saints and heroes long before us
firmly on this ground have stood
see their banners waving o’er us
conquerors though jesus’ blood

deathless we are all unfearing
life laid up with christ in god
in the morn of his appearing
floweth forth a glory flood 

soon we all shall stand before him
see and know our glorious lord
soon in joy and light adore him
each receiving his reward
