rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee
let the water and the blood
from thy wounded side which flowed
be of sin the double cure
cleanse me from its guilt and powr

not the labour of my hand
can fulfil thy laws demand
could my zeal no respite know
could my tears for ever flow
all for sin could not atone
thou must save and thou alone

nothing in my hands i bring
simply to thy cross i cling
naked come to thee for dress
helpless look to thee for grace
foul i to the fountain fly
cleanse me saviour or i die

while i draw this fleeting breath
when mine eyes are closed in death
while i soar through tracks unknown 
see thee on thy judgement throne
rock of ages cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee
