on the cross crucified in great sorrow he died 
the giver of life was he 
yet my lord was despised and rejected of men 
this jesus of calvary

    he was wounded for our transgressions 
    he was bruised for our iniquities 
    surely he bore our sorrows
    and by his stripes we are healed

price for healing was paid
as those cruel stripes were made
within pilates judgement hall 
now his suffring afford perfect healing for all 
this wonderful healers mine

came the leper to christ saying surely i know 
that thou lord canst make me whole 
when his great faith was seen
jesus said yes i will
and touched him and made him clean

he has healed my sick soul 
made me evry whit whole
and hell do the same for you 
hes the same yesterday and today and for aye 
this healer of men today
