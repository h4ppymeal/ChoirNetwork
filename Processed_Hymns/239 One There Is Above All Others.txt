one there is above all others
well deserves the name of friend
his is love beyond a brothers
costly free and knows no end
they who once his kindness prove
find it everlasting love

which of all our friends to save us
could or would have shed his blood
but our jesus died to have us
reconciled in him to god
this was boundless love indeed
jesus is a friend in need

when he lived on earth abased
friend of sinners was his name
now above all glory raised
he rejoices in the same
still he calls them brethren friends
and to all their wants attends

o for grace our hearts to soften
teach us lord at length to love
we alas forget too often
what a friend we have above
but when home our souls are brought
we will love you as we ought
