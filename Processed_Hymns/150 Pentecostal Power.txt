lord as of old at pentecost
thou didst thy pow’r display—
with cleansing purifying flame
descend on us today

    lord send the oldtime power the pentecostal power
    thy floodgates of blessing on us throw open wide
    lord send the oldtime power the pentecostal power
    that sinners be converted and thy name glorified

for mighty works for thee prepare
and strengthen every heart
come take possession of thine own
and nevermore depart

all self consume all sin destroy
with earnest zeal endue
each waiting heart to work for thee
o lord our faith renew

speak lord before thy throne we wait
thy promise we believe
and will not let thee go until
the blessing we receive
