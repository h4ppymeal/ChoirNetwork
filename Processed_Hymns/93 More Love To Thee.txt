more love to thee o christ more love to thee
hear thou the prayer i make on bended knee
this is my earnest plea more love o christ to thee
more love to thee more love to thee

once earthly joy i craved sought peace and rest
now thee alone i seek give what is best
this all my prayer shall be more love o christ to thee
more love to thee more love to thee

let sorrow do its work come grief or pain
sweet are thy messengers sweet their refrain
when they can sing with me more love o christ to thee
more love to thee more love to thee

then shall my latest breath whisper thy praise
this be the parting cry my heart shall raise
this still its prayer shall be more love o christ to thee
more love to thee more love to thee
