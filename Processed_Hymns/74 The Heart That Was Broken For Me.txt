there came from the skies in the days long ago
the lord with a message of love
the world knew him not he was treated with scorn—
this wonderful gift from above

    they crown’d him with thorns
    he was beaten with stripes
    he was smitten and nailed to the tree
    but the pain in his heart was the hardest to bear
    the heart that was broken for me

he came to his own—to the ones that he lov’d—
the sheep that had wander’d astray
they heard not his voice but the friend of mankind
was hated and driven away

the birds have their nest and the foxes have holes
but he had no place for his head
a pallet of stone on the cold mountainside
was all that he had for his bed

i cannot reject such a saviour as he
dishonor and wound him again
i will go to his feet and repent of my sin
be willing to suffer the pain

i will take up my cross i will walk by his side
for the pathway of duty i see
i will follow my lord and abide in his heart
the heart that was broken for me
