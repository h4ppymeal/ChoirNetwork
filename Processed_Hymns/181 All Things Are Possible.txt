all things are possible to him
that can in jesus name believe
lord i no more thy truth blaspheme
thy truth i lovingly receive
i can i do believe in thee
all things are possible to me 

the most impossible of all
is that i eer from sin should cease
yet shall it be i know it shall
jesus look to thy faithfulness
if nothing is too hard for thee
all things are possible to me 

though earth and hell the word gainsay
the word of god can never fail
the lamb shall take my sins away
tis certain though impossible
the thing impossible shall be
all things are possible to me 

when thou the work of faith hast wrought
i here shall in thine image shine
nor sin in deed or word or thought
let men exclaim and fiends repine
they cannot break the firm decree
all things are possible to me 

thy mouth o lord hath spoke hath sworn
that i shall serve thee without fear
shall find the pearl which others spurn
holy and pure and perfect here
the servant as his lord shall be
all things are possible to me 

all things are possible to god
to christ the power of god in man
to me when i am all renewed
when i in christ am formed again
and witness from all sin set free
all things are possible to me
