sinners jesus will receive 
sound this word of grace to all 
who the heavnly pathway leave 
all who linger all who fall

    sing it oer and oer again
    christ receiveth sinful men
    make the messages clear and plain
    christ receiveth sinful me
    
come and he will give you rest 
trust him for his word is plain 
he will take the sinfulest 
christ receiveth sinful men

now my heart condemns me not 
pure before the law i stand 
he who cleansed me from all spot 
satisfied its last demand

christ receiveth sinful men 
even me with all my sin 
purged from ev’ry spot and stain 
heav’n with him i enter in
