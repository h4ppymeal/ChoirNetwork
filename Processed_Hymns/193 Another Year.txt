another year is dawning 
a path unknown untried
t’would fill me with foreboding
had i no hand to guide 
but he who walked beside me 
all through the yesteryear 
whatever may betide me
has promised to be near

another year with jesus 
an then no dread i know
his love is ever precious
howe’er the winds may blow
e’en when the storm is fiercest
in him my soul may rest 
and find sweet peace and comfort
upon his loving breast

another year to trust him
yes i can trust him still 
who never yet has failed me
as i have sought his will 
his rod and staff he giveth 
to be my strength and stay
and tenderly he leadeth 
along the homeward way

another year to serve him
to labor for him here 
e’en while the shadows lengthen 
and night is drawing near
i no not when he will call me to lay my sickle by
oh may i then be faithful while now the moments fly

another year to love him
whom i have loved so long
another year to praise him in glad triumphant song
what’er the future holdeth of sorrow toil or pain
his precious love endureth forevermore the same

another year with jesus
i thank thee lord today
for thy unfailing presence along life’s rugged way
guide me o blest redeemer 
teach me to do thy will 
and thine own perfect purpose 
in me each day fulfill
