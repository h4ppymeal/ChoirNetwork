in the harvest field now ripened
there is a work for all to do
hark the voice of god is calling
to the harvest calling you

    little is much when god is in it
    labor not for wealth or fame
    there is a crown—and you can win it
    if you go in jesus’ name

in the mad rush of the broad way
in the hurry and the strife
tell of jesus’ love and mercy
give to them the word of life

does the place you are called to labor
seem too small and little known
it is great if god is in it
and he will not forget his own

are you laid aside from service
body worn from toil and care
you can still be in the battle
in the sacred place of prayer

when the conflict here is ended
and our race on earth is run
he will say if we are faithful
“welcome home my child—well done
