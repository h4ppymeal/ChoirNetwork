who will be the next to follow jesus
who will be the next his cross to bear
someone is ready someone is waiting
who will be the next a crown to wear

    who will be the next who will be the next
    who will be the next to follow jesus
    who will be the next to follow les us now
    follow jesus now

who will be the next to follow jesus
come and bow at his precious feet
who will be the next to lay every burden
down at the father’s mercy seat

who will be the next to follow jesus
who will be the next to praise his name
who will swell the chorus of free redemption
sing hallelujah praise the lamb

who will be the next to follow jesus
down through the jordan’s rolling tide
who will be the next to join with the ransomed
singing upon the other side
