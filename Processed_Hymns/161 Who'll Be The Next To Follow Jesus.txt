wholl be the next to follow jesus
who’ll be the next his cross to bear
someone is ready someone is waiting
who’ll be the next a crown to wear

    who’ll be the next who’ll be the next
    who’ll be the next to follow jesus
    who’ll be the next to follow les us now
    follow jesus now

who’ll be the next to follow jesus
come and bow at his precious feet
who’ll be the next to lay every burden
down at the father’s mercy seat

who’ll be the next to follow jesus
who’ll be the next to praise his name
who’ll swell the chorus of free redemption
sing hallelujah praise the lamb

who’ll be the next to follow jesus
down through the jordan’s rolling tide
who’ll be the next to join with the ransomed
singing upon the other side
