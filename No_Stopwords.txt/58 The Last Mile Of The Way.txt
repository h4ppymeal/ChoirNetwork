if i walk in the pathway of duty
if i work till the close of the day
i shall see the great king in his beauty
when i have gone the last mile of the way

when i have gone the last mile of the way
i will rest at the close of the day
and i know there are joys that await me
when i have gone the last mile of the way

if for christ i proclaim the glad story
if i seek for his sheep gone astray
i am sure he will show me his glory
when i have gone the last mile of the way

here the dearest of ties we must sever
tears of sorrow are seen everyday
but no sickness no sighing forever
when i have gone the last mile of the way

and if here i have earnestly striven
and have tried all his will to obey
'twill enhance all the rapture of heaven
when i have gone the last mile of the way
