have you wandered away from your father's care
heavy hearted and sad do you roam
there is a sweet gentle voice calling now to you
wandring child wand'ring child o come home

    child come home child come home
    wand'ring child why longer roam
    it is thy father entreats
    wand'ring child o come home

is your frail bark adrift on life's raging sea
are you tossed on its billows and foam
there is a safe harbor home waiting now for you
wandring child wand'ring child o come home 

he is pleading today heed his gentle voice
as he bids you no longer to roam
to that dear father's house haste without delay 
wandring child wand'ring child o come home
