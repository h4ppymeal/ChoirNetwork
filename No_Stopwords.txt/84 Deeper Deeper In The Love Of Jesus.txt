deeper deeper in the love of jesus
daily let me go
higher higher in the school of wisdom
more of grace to know

    o deeper yet i pray
    and higher everyday
    and wiser blessed lord
    in thy precious holy word

deeper deeper blessed holy spirit
take me deeper still
till my life is wholly lost in jesus
and his perfect will

deeper deeper though it cost hard trials
deeper let me go
rooted in the holy love of jesus
let me fruitful grow

deeper higher everyday in jesus
till all conflict past
finds me conqu'ror and in his own image
perfected at last
