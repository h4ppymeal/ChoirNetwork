o give us homes built firm upon the saviour
where christ is head and counsellor and guide
where ev'ry child is taught his love and favor
and gives his heart to christ the crucified
how sweet to know that though' his footsteps waver
his faithful lord is walking by his side

o give us homes with godly fathers mothers
who always place their hope and trust in him
whose tender patience turmoil never bothers
whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim
a home where each finds joy in serving others
and love still shines though' days be dark and grim

o give us homes where christ is lord and master
the bible read the precious hymns still sung
where prayer comes first in peace or in disaster
and praise is natural speech to ev'ry tongue
where mountains move before a faith that is vaster
and christ sufficient is for old and young

o lord our god our homes are thine forever
we trust to thee their problems toil and care
their bonds of love no enemy can sever
if thou art always lord and master there
be thou the center of our least endeavor
be thou our guest our hearts and homes to share
