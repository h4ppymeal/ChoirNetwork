prayer is the soul’s sincere desire
uttered or unexpressed
the motion of a hidden fire
that trembles in the breast

prayer is the burden of a sigh
the falling of a tear
the upward glancing of an eye
when none but god is near

prayer is the simplest form of speech
that infant lips can try
prayer the sublimest strains that reach
the majesty on high

prayer is the christian’s vital breath
the christian’s native air
his watchword at the gates of death
he enters rest with prayer

the saints in prayer appear as one
in word and deed and mind
while with the father and the son
sweet fellowship they find

o thou by whom we come to god
he life the truth the way
the path of prayer thyself hast trod—
lord teach us how to pray
