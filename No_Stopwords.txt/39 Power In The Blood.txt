would you be free from your burden of sin
there is pow'r in the blood pow'r in the blood
would you over evil a victory win
there is wonderful pow'r in the blood

    there is pow'r pow'r wonderworking pow'r
    in the blood of the lamb
    there is pow'r pow'r wonderworking pow'r
    in the precious blood of the lamb

would you be free from your passion and pride
there is pow'r in the blood pow'r in the blood
come for a cleansing to calvary's tide
there is wonderful pow'r in the blood

would you be whiter much whiter than snow
there is pow'r in the blood pow'r in the blood
sin stains are lost in its lifegiving flow
there is wonderful pow'r in the blood

would you do service for jesus your king
there is pow'r in the blood pow'r in the blood
would you live daily his praises to sing
there is wonderful pow'r in the blood
