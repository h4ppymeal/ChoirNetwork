standing on the promises of christ my king
through eternal ages let his praises ring
glory in the highest i will shout and sing
standing on the promises of god

    standing standing
    standing on the promises of god my saviour
    standing standing
    i am standing on the promises of god

standing on the promises that cannot fail
when the howling storms of doubt and fear assail
by the living word of god i shall prevail
standing on the promises of god

standing on the promises i now can see
perfect present cleansing in the blood for me
standing in the liberty where christ makes free
standing on the promises of god

standing on the promises of christ the lord
bound to him eternally by love's strong cord
overcoming daily by the spirit's sword
standing on the promises of god

standing on the promises i cannot fall
list'ning ev'ry moment to the spirit's call
resting in my saviour as my all in all
standing on the promises of god
