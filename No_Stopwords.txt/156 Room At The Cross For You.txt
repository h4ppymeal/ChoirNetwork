the cross upon which jesus died
is a shelter in which we can hide
and its grace so free is sufficient for me
and deep is its fountain as wide as the sea

    there is room at the cross for you
    there is room at the cross for you
    though millions have come there is still room for one
    yes there is room at the cross for you

though millions have found him a friend
and have turned from the sins they have sinned
the savior still waits to open the gates
and welcome a sinner before it is too late

the hand of my savior is strong
and the love of my savior is long
through sunshine or rain through loss or in gain
the blood flows from calvary to cleanse every stain
