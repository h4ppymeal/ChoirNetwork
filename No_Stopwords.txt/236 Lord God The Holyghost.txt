lord god the holy ghost
in this accepted hour
as on the day of pentecost
descend in all thy power

we meet with one accord
in our appointed place
and wait the promise of our lord
the spirit of all grace

like mighty rushing wind
upon the waves beneath
move with one impulse every mind
one soul one feeling breathe

the young the old inspire
with wisdom from above
and give us hearts and tongues of fire
to pray and praise and love

spirit of light explore
and chase our gloom away
with luster shining more and more
unto the perfect day

spirit of truth be thou
in life and death our guide
o spirit of adoption now
may we be sanctified
