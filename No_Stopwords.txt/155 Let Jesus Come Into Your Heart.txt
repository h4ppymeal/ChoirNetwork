if you are tired of the load of your sin
let jesus come into your heart
if you desire a new life to begin
let jesus come into your heart

    just now your doubtings give over
    just now reject him no more
    just now throw open the door
    let jesus come into your heart

if it is for purity now that you sigh
let jesus come into your heart
fountains for cleansing are flowing nearby
let jesus come into your heart

if there is a tempest your voice cannot still
let jesus come into your heart
if there is a void this world never can fill
let jesus come into your heart

if you would join the glad songs of the blest
let jesus come into your heart
if you would enter the mansions of rest
let jesus come into your heart
