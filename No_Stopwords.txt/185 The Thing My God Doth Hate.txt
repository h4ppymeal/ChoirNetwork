the things my god doth hate
that i no more may do
thy creature lord again create
and all my soul renew

my soul shall then like thine
abhor the thing unclean
and sanctify'd thy love divine
for ever cease from sin

that blessed law of thine
jesu to me impart
thy spirit's law of life divine
oh write it in my heart

implant it deep within
whence it may never remove
the law of liberty from sin
the perfect law of love

thy nature be my law
thy spotless sanctity
and sweetly ev'ry moment draw
my happy soul to thee

soul of my soul remain
who didst for all fulfil
in me o lord fulfil again
thy heav'nly father's will
