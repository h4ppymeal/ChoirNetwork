o worship the king all glorious above
o gratefully sing his power and his love
our shield and defender the ancient of days
pavillion'd in splendour and girded with praise

o tell of his might o sing of his grace
whose robe is the light whose canopy space
his chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form
and dark is his path on the wings of the storm

thy bountiful care what tongue can recite
it breathes in the air it shines in the light
it streams from the hills it descends to the plain
and sweetly distils in the dew and the rain

frail children of dust and feeble as frail
in thee do we trust nor find thee to fail
thy mercies how tender how firm to the end
our maker defender redeemer and friend

o measureless might ineffable love
while angels delight to hymn thee above
the humbler creation though feeble their lays
with true adoration shall lisp to thy praise
