 
 will your anchor hold in the storms of life
 when the clouds unfold their wings of strife
 when the strong tides lift and the cables strain
 will your anchor drift or firm remain
 
    we have an anchor that keeps the soul
    steadfast and sure while the billows roll
    fasten'd to the rock which cannot move
    grounded firm and deep in the saviour's love
 
 it is safely moored 'twill the storms withstand
 for it is well secured by the saviour's hand
 and the cables passed from his heart to mine
 can defy the blast through strength divine
 
 it will firmly hold in the straits of fear
 when the breakers have told the reef is near
 though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow
 not an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow
 
 it will surely hold in the floods of death
 when the waters cold chill our latest breath
 on the rising tide it can never fail
 while our hopes abide within the veil
 
 when our eyes behold through the gathering night
 the city of gold our harbour bright
 we shall anchor fast by the heavenly shore
 with the storms all past for evermore
