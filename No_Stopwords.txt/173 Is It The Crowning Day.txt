jesus may come today
glad day glad day
and i would see my friend
dangers and troubles would end
if jesus should come today

    glad day glad day
    is it the crowning day
    i will live for today nor anxious be
    jesus my lord i soon shall see
    glad day glad day
    is it the crowning day

i may go home today
glad day glad day
seemeth i hear their song
hail to the radiant throng
if i should go home today

why should i anxious be
glad day glad day
lights appear on the shore
storms will affright nevermore
for he is “at hand” today

faithful i will be today
glad day glad day
and i will freely tell
why i should love him so well
for he is my all today
