1 i am bought not with riches
neither silver nor gold
but christ hath redeemed me
i am safe in his fold
in the book of his kingdom
with its pages so fair
through jesus my saviour
my name's written there

    my name's written there
    on the page white and fair
    in the book of god's kingdom
    my name's written there

my sins they were many
like the sands of the sea
but the blood of my saviour
is sufficient for me
for his promise is written
in bright letters that glow
though your sins be as scarlet
i will make them like snow

oh that beautiful city
with its mansions of light
with its glorified beings
in pure garments of white
where no evil thing cometh
to despoil what is fair
where the angels are watching
my name's written there
