since the saviour came to this heart of mine
my cups filled and running over
filling my poor soul with his joy divine
my cup's filled and running over

    running over running over
    my cups filled and running over
    since the lord saved me
    i am as happy as can be
    my cup's filled and running over

with my lord so dear
i have naught to fear
my cup's filled and running over
though my way be drear
he is ever near
my cup's filled and running over

even though i walk
through the death's darksome vale
my cup's filled and running over
christ my lord shall be
my comfort still
my cup's filled and running over

sinner seek the lord
trust his precious word
while the angels round you hover
heaven's bells will ring
and you then will sing
my cup's filled and running over
