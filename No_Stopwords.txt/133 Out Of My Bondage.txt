out of my bondage sorrow and night
jesus i come jesus i come
into thy freedom gladness and light
jesus i come to thee
out of my sickness into thy health
out of my want and into thy wealth
out of my sin and into thyself
jesus i come to thee

out of my shameful failure and loss
jesus i come jesus i come
into the glorious gain of thy cross
jesus i come to thee
out of earth's sorrows into thy balm
out of life's storms and into thy calm
out of distress to jubilant psalm
jesus i come to thee

out of unrest and arrogant pride
jesus i come jesus i come
into thy blessed will to abide
jesus i come to thee
out of myself to dwell in thy love
out of despair into raptures above
upward for aye on wings like a dove
jesus i come to thee

out of the fear and dread of the tomb
jesus i come jesus i come
into the joy and light of thy home
jesus i come to thee
out of the depths of ruin untold
into the peace of thy sheltering fold
ever thy glorious face to behold
jesus i come to thee
