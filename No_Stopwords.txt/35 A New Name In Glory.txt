i was once a sinner but i came
pardon to receive from my lord
this was freely given and i found
that he always kept his word 

    there is a new name written down in glory
    and it is mine o yes it is mine
    and the white robed angels sing the story
    a sinner has come home
    for there is a new name written down in glory
    and it is mine o yes it is mine
    with my sins forgiven i am bound for heaven
    never more to roam 

i was humbly kneeling at the cross
fearing naught but god's angry frown
when the heavens opened and i saw
that my name was written down 

in the book it is written saved by grace
o the joy that came to my soul
now i am forgiven and i know
by the blood i am made whole
