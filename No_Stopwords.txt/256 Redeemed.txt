redeemedâ€”how i love to proclaim it
redeemed by the blood of the lamb
redeemed through his infinite mercy
his child and forever i am

    redeemed redeemed
    redeemed by the blood of the lamb
    redeemed redeemed
    his child and forever i am

redeemed and so happy in jesus
no language my rapture can tell
i know that the light of his presence
with me doth continually dwell

i think of my blessed redeemer
i think of him all the day long
i sing for i cannot be silent
his love is the theme of my song

i know i shall see in his beauty
the king in whose way i delight
who lovingly guardeth my footsteps
and giveth me songs in the night
