once again the gospel message
from the saviour you have heard
will you heed the invitation
will you turn and seek the lord

    come believing come believing
    come to jesus look and live
    come believing come believing
    come to jesus look and live

many summers you have wasted
ripen'd harvests you have seen
winter snows by spring have melted
yet you linger in your sin

jesus for your choice is waiting
tarry not at once decide
while the spirit now is striving
yield and seek the saviour's side

cease of fitness to be thinking
do not longer try to feel
it is trusting and not feeling
that will give the spirit's seal

let your will to god be given
trust in christ's atoning blood
look to jesus now in heaven
rest on his unchanging word
