i can hear my savior calling
i can hear my savior calling

â€œtake thy cross and follow follow me

    where he leads me i will follow
    where he leads me i will follow
    where he leads me i will follow
    i will go with him with him all the way

i will go with him through the garden
i will go with him through the garden
i will go with him through the garden
i will go with him with him all the way

i will go with him through the judgment
i will go with him through the judgment
i will go with him through the judgment
i will go with him with him all the way

he will give me grace and glory
he will give me grace and glory
he will give me grace and glory
and go with me with me all the way
