1 tell the whole wide world of jesus
bear the news from shore to shore
telling sinners of the savior
let the light spread more and more

    tell the world the whole wide world
    bear the news from shore to shore
    tell the whole wide world of jesus
    praise his name forevermore

send abroad the gospel heralds
let them take the bless√®d light
into every land of darkness
piercing through the shades of night

yes we will send the joyful message
over mountain over wave
telling everywhere of jesus
and his mighty power to save

while we pray for other nations
send them help with willing hand
let us not forget the home fields
jesus for our native land
