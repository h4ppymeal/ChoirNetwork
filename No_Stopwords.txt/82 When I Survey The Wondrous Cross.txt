when i survey the wondrous cross
on which the prince of glory died
my richest gain i count but loss
and pour contempt on all my pride

forbid it lord that i should boast
save in the death of christ my god
and the vain things that charm me most
i sacrifice them to his blood

see from his head his hands his feet
sorrow and love flow mingled down
did ever such love and sorrow met
or thorns compose so rich a crown

were the whole realm of nature mine
that were an offering far too small
love so amazing so divine
demands my soul my life my all
