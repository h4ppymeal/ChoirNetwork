o lord my god when i in awesome wonder
consider all the works thy hand hath made
i see the stars i hear the mighty thunder
thy power throughout the universe displayed

    then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
    how great thou art how great thou art
    then sings my soul my saviour god to thee
    how great thou art how great thou art

when through the woods and forest glades i wander
and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
when i look down from lofty mountain grandeur
and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

and when i think that god his son not sparing
sent him to die  i scarce can take it in
that on the cross my burden gladly bearing
he bled and died to take away my sin

when christ shall come with shout of acclamation
and take me home  what joy shall fill my heart
then shall i bow in humble adoration
and there proclaim my god how great thou art
