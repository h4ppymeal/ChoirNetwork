1 are you trusting the love of the savior divine
does his smile make the darkest day bright
are you laying on him all the burdens that fret
does the cross that he gave you seem light

    tell somebody tell somebody
    all of the wonderful love you know
    tell somebody tell somebody
    christ and his goodness show

are you resting today â€˜neath the sheltering rock
have you given your lord full control
are you glad in the love that redeemed you from sin
has he spoken his peace to your soul 

is there victory now where there once was defeat
blessed triumph through jesus alone
tell somebody today of a master and friend
and his wonderful mercy make known
