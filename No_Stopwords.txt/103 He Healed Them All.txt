he healed them all – the blind the lame the palsied
the sick in body and the weak in mind
whoever came no matter how afflicted
were sure a sovereign remedy to find

his word gave health his touch restored the vigour
to every weary painexhausted frame
and all he asked before he gave the blessing
was simple faith in him from those who came

and is our lord the kind the good the tender
less loving now than in those days of old
or is it that our faith is growing feeble
and christian energy is waxing cold

why do we not with equal expectation
now bring our sick ones to the lord in prayer
right through the throng of unbelieving scruples
up to his very side and leave them there

he never health refused in bygone ages
nor feared to take the “chastisement” away
then why not ask it now instead of praying
for “patience” to endure from day to day
