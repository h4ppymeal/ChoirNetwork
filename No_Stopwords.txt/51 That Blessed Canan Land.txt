there is a blessed land that we call canaan
land of promise land of victory
where the spirit's given without measure
where the soul from self has been set free

    it is wonderful to live in canaan
    where the milk and honey flow
    where the land is bearing in abundance
    and the grapes of eschol grow
    it is wonderful to live in canaan
    where the milk and honey flow
    will not you join that band
    where the live is grand
    in that blessed canaan land

in the land of canaan there is blessing
all his fullness as he takes control
blessed fullness of the holy spirit
o what glory he brings to the soul 

have you crossed the jordan into canaan
have you left the wilderness behind
and received the spirit in his fullness
if you have not then make up your mind
