since the son hath made me free
let me taste my liberty
thee behold with open face
triumph in thy saving grace
thy great will delight to prove
glory in thy perfect love

abba father hear thy child
late in jesus reconciled
hear and all the graces shower
all the joy and peace and power
all my savior asks above
all the life and heaven of love

lord i will not let thee go
till the blessing thou bestow
hear my advocate divine
lo to his my suit i join
joined to his it cannot fail
bless me for i will prevail

heavenly adam life divine
change my nature into thine
move and spread throughout my soul
actuate and fill the whole
be it i no longer now
living in the flesh but thou

holy ghost no more delay
come and in thy temple stay
now thine inward witness bear
strong and permanent and clear
spring of life thyself impart
rise eternal in my heart
