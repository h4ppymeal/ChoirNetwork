simply trusting every day
trusting through a stormy way
even when my faith is small
trusting jesus that is all

	trusting as the moments fly
	trusting as the days go by
	trusting him whateâ€™er befall
	trusting jesus that is all

brightly doth his spirit shine
into this poor heart of mine
while he leads i cannot fall
trusting jesus that is all

singing if my way be clear
praying if the path be drear
if in danger for him call
trusting jesus that is all

trusting him while life shall last
trusting him till earth is past
till his gracious advent call
trusting jesus that is all
