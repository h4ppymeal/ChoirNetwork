out in the darkness of sorrow and sin
somebody needs your love
led by the master that soul you may win
somebody needs your love

    somebody needs your love
    somebody needs your love
    someone in sadness
    yearning for gladness
    somebody needs your love

many are helpless and wait for your call
somebody needs your love
show them that jesus is all and in all
somebody needs your love

some one is tempted to turn from the right
somebody needs your love
longing for courage and strength for the fight
somebody needs your love

some are downhearted in sorrow they roam
somebody needs your love
many are sighing for heaven and home
somebody needs your love
