i am pressing on the upward way
new heights i am gaining everyday
still praying as i onward bound
lord plant my feet on higher ground

    lord lift me up and let me stand
    by faith on heaven's table land
    a higher plane than i have found
    lord plant my feet on higher ground

my heart has no desire to stay
where doubts arise and fears dismay
though' some may dwell where these abound
my pray'r my aim is higher ground

i want to live above the world
though satan's darts at me are hurled
but still i will pray till heav'n i have found
lord lead me on to higher ground

i want to scale the utmost height
and catch a gleam of glory bright
for faith has caught the joyful sound
the song of saints on higher ground
