so send i you to labour unrewarded
to serve unpaid unloved unsought unknown
to bear rebuke ot suffer scorn and scoffing
so send i you to toil for me alone

    as the father hath sent me so send i you

so send i you to bind the bruised and broken
over wandering souls to work to weep to wake
to bear the burdens of a world aweary
so send i you to suffer for my sake

so send i you to loneliness and longing
with hart ahungering for tthe loved and known
forsaking kin and kindred friend and dear one
so send i you to know my love alone

so send i you to leave your life's ambition
to die to dear desire selfwill resign
to labour long and love where men revile you
so send i you to lsoe you life in mine

so send i you to hearts made hard by hatred
to eyes made blind because they will not see
to spend though it be blood to spend and spare not
so send i you to taste of calvary
