i shall see the king
where the angels sing
i shall see the king some day
in the better land
on the golden strand
and with him shall ever stay

    in his glory i shall see the king
    and forever endless praises sing
    it was on calvary jesus died for me
    i shall see the king some day

in the land of song
in the glorythrong
where there never comes a night
with my lord once slain
i shall ever reign
in the gloryland of light

i shall see the king
all my tributes bring
and shall look upon his face
then my song shall be
how he ransomed me
and has kept me by his grace
