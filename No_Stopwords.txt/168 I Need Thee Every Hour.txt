i need thee every hour
most gracious lord
no tender voice like thine
can peace afford

    i need thee oh i need thee
    every hour i need thee
    oh bless me now my saviour
    i come to thee

i need thee every hour
stay thou nearby
temptations lose their power
when thou art nigh

i need thee every hour
teach me thy will
and thy rich promises
in me fulfil

i need thee every hour
most holy one
oh make me thine indeed
thou blessed son
