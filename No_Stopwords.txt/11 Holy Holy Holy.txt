holy holy holy lord god almighty
early in the morning our song shall rise to thee
holy holy holy merciful and mighty
god in three persons blessed trinity

holy holy holy all the saints adore thee
casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea
cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee
who wert and art and evermore shall be

holy holy holy though the darkness hide thee
though the eye of sinful man thy glory may not see
only thou art holy there is none beside thee
perfect in power in love and purity

holy holy holy lord god almighty
all thy works shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea
holy holy holy merciful and mighty
god in three persons blessed trinity
