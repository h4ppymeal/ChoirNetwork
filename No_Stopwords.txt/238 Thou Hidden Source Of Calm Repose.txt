thou hidden source of calm repose
thou allsufficient love divine
my help and refuge from my foes
secure i am if thou art mine
and lo from sin and grief and shame
i hide me jesus in thy name

thy mighty name salvation is
and keeps my happy soul above
comfort it brings and power and peace
and joy and everlasting love
to me with thy dear name are given
pardon and holiness and heaven

jesus my all in all thou art
my rest in toil my ease in pain
the medicine of my broken heart
in war my peace in loss my gain
my smile beneath the tyrant's frown
in shame my glory and my crown

in want my plentiful supply
in weakness my almighty power
in bonds my perfect liberty
my light in satan's darkest hour
in grief my joy unspeakable
my life in death my heavenmy all
