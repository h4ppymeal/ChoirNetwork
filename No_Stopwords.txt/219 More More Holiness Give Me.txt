more sorrow for sin
more faith in my savior
more sense of his care
more joy in his service 
more purpose in prayer

more gratitude give me 
more trust in the lord
more pride in his glory 
more hope in his word
more tears for his sorrows 
more pain at his grief
more meekness in trial 
more praise for relief

more purity give me 
more strength to o’ercome
more freedom from earthstains
more longings for home
more fit for the kingdom 
more used would i be
more blessèd and holy 
more savior like thee
