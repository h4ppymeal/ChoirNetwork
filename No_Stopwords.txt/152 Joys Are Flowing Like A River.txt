joys are flowing like a river
since the comforter has come
he abides with us for ever
makes the trusting heart his home

    blessed quietness holy quietness
    what assurance in my soul 
    on the stormy sea he speaks peace to me
    how the billows cease to roll

bringing life and health and gladness
all around this heav'nly guest
banish'd unbelief and sadness
chang'd our weariness to rest

like the rain that falls from heaven
like the sunlight from the sky
so the holy ghost is given
coming on us from on high

what a wonderful salvation
where we always see his face
what a perfect habitation
what a quiet restingplace
