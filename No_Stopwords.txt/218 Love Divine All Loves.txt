love divine all loves excelling
joy of heaven to earth come down
fix in us thy humble dwelling
all thy faithful mercies crown
jesus thou art all compassion
pure unbounded love thou art
visit us with thy salvation
enter every trembling heart

breathe o breathe thy loving spirit
into every troubled breast
let us all in thee inherit
let us find that second rest
take away our bent to sinning
alpha and omega be
end of faith as its beginning
set our hearts at liberty

come almighty to deliver
let us all thy life receive
suddenly return and never
never more thy temples leave
thee we would be always blessing
serving as thy hosts above
pray and praise thee without ceasing
glory in thy perfect love

finish then thy new creation
pure and spotless let us be
let us see thy great salvation
perfectly restored in thee
changed from glory into glory
till in heaven we take our place
till we cast our crowns before thee
lost in wonder love and praise
