i will tell the world that i am a christian â€“
i am not ashamed his name to bear
i will tell the world that i am a christian
i will take him with me anywhere
i will tell the world how jesus saved me
and how he gave me a life brandnew
and i know that if you trust him
that all he gave me he will give to you
i will tell the world that he is my saviour
no other one could love me so
my life my all is his for ever
and where he leads me i will go

i will tell the world that he is coming
it may be near or far away
but we must live as if his coming
shall be tomorrow or today
for when he comes and life is over
for those who love him there is more to be
eyes have never seen the wonders
that he is preparing for you and me
o tell the world that you are a christian
be not ashamed his name to bear
o tell the world that you are a christian
and take him with you ev'rywhere
