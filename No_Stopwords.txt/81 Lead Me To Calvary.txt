king of my life i crown thee now
thine shall the glory be
lest i forget thy thorncrowned brow
lead me to calvary

    lest i forget gethsemane
    lest i forget thine agony
    lest i forget thy love for me
    lead me to calvary
    
show me the tomb where thou wast laid
tenderly mourned and wept
angels in robes of light arrayed
guarded thee whilst thou slept

let me like mary thru the gloom
come with a gift to thee
show to me now the empty tomb 
lead me to calvary

may i be willing lord to bear
daily my cross for thee
even thy cup of grief to share
thou hast borne all for me
