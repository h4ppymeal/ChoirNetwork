thou my everlasting portion
more than friend or life to me
all along my pilgrim journey
saviour let me walk with thee

    close to thee close to thee
    close to thee close to thee
    all along my pilgrim journey
    saviour let me walk with thee

not for ease or worldly pleasure
or for fame my pray'r shall be
gladly will i toil and suffer
only let me walk with thee

close to thee close to thee
close to thee close to thee
gladly will i toil and suffer
only let me walk with thee

lead me thro' the vale of shadow
bear me over life's fitful sea
then the gate of life eternal
may i enter lord with thee

close to thee close to thee
close to thee close to thee
then the gates of life eternal
may i enter lord with thee
