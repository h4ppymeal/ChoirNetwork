like the woman at the well i was seeking –
for things that could not satisfy
and then i heard my saviour speaking –
draw from my well that never shall run dry

    fill my cup lord i lift it up lord
    come and quench this thirsting of my soul
    bread of heaven feed me till i want no more
    fill my cup fill it up and make me whole

there are millions in this world who are craving – 
the pleasures earthly things afford
but none can match the wondrous treasure – 
that i find in jesus christ my lord

so my brother if the things this world gave you –
leave hungers that will not pass away
my blessed lord will come and save you
if you kneel to him and humbly pray
