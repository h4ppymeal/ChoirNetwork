just as god who reigns on high
spake to men in days gone by
so the lord is calling men today
and my brother this is true
whatsoe'er he says to you
there is but one thing to do 
just obey

    just obey    just obey   
    is the way    god's way   
    when his message comes to you
    there is but one thing to do
    just obey    just obey

if you are in the saviour's hands
you must do as he commands
for there is no other gospel way
never put the message by
never stop to reason why
when the saviour speaks to you 
just obey

if for mansions fair you sigh
in that land beyond the sky
after time with you has pass'd away
though the way you may not see
christ is calling follow me
faith and duty both will cry 
just obey
