go and tell the story to thy friends today
how the lord of glory met thee on thy way
how he cleansed thy spirit from the stain of sin
driving out the foe who reigned thy heart within

    go and tell the story tell it fer and wide
    how the lord of glory for the sinner died
    and the soul that hears it and in faith believes
    straightway he the cleansing from the lord receives

go and tell the story of his pow'r to save
of the sinful legion sunk beneath the wave
tell of his compassion of his love so true
of the wondrous things the lord hath done for you

go and tell the story how he reigns above
winning men to glory thro' his dying love
how he waits to crown them kings forevermore
in the home awaiting on the other shore
