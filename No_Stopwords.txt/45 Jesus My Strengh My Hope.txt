jesus my strength my hope
on thee i cast my care
with humble confidence look up
and know thou hearest prayer
give me on thee to wait
till i can all things do
on thee almighty to create
almighty to renew

i want a sober mind
a selfrenouncing will
that tramples down and casts behind
the baits of pleasing ill
a soul inured to pain
to hardship grief and loss
bold to take up firm to sustain
the consecrated cross

i want a godly fear
a quickdiscerning eye
that looks to thee when sin is near
and sees the tempter fly
a spirit still prepared
and armed with jealous care
for ever standing on its guard
and watching unto prayer


i rest upon thy word
the promise is for me
my succour and salvation lord
shall surely come from thee
but let me still abide
nor from my hope remove
till thou my patient spirit guide
into thy perfect love
