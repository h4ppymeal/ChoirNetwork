yield not to temptation for yielding is sin
each victory will help you some other to win
fight manfully onward dark passions subdue
look ever to jesus he will carry you through

    ask the saviour to help you
    comfort strengthen and keep you
    he is willing to aid you
    he will carry you through

shun evil companions bad language disdain
god's name hold in reverence nor take it in vain
be thoughtful and earnest kindhearted and true
look ever to jesus he will carry you through

to him that o'ercometh god giveth a crown
through faith we will conquer though often cast down
he who is our saviour our strength will renew
look ever to jesus he will carry you through
