oh do not let thy lord depart
and close thine eyes against the light
poor sinner harden not thy heart
be saved o tonight

    o why not tonight o why not tonight
    wilt thou ne saved
    then why not tonight

tomorrow’s sun may never rise
to bless thy longdeluded sight
this is the time—oh then be wise
be saved o tonight

our god in pity lingers still
oh wilt thou thus his love requite
renounce at length thy stubborn will
be saved o tonight

our blessèd lord refuses none
who would to him their souls unite
believe obey the work is done
be saved o tonight
