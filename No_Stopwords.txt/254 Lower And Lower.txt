lower and lower dear lord at thy feet
seeking thy spirit thy mercy so sweet
down in our need blessed master we fall
lower and lower be thou all in all

lower and lower down at thy cross
all the worldâ€™s treasure counting but dross
down at thy feet blessed savior we fall
lower still lower christ all in all

lower and lower dear savior we pray
losing the selflife still more every day
weak and unworthy we are looking above
empty us wholly then fill us with love

lower and lower yet higher we rise
lifted in christ freed from all the earth ties
humbly we follow the way of the cross
then crowns of glory and gain for all loss
