while passing through this world of sin
and others your life shall view
be clean and pure without within
let others see jesus in you

    let others see jesus in you…
    let others see jesus in you…
    keep telling the story be faithful and true
    let others see jesus in you

your life's a book before their eyes
they are reading it through and through
say does it point them to the skies
do others see jesus in you

what joy 'twill be at set of sun
in mansions beyond the blue
to find some souls that you have won
let others see jesus in you

then live for christ both day and night
be faithful be brave and true
and lead the lost to life and light
let others see jesus in you
