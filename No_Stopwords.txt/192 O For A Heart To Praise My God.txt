o for a heart to praise my god
a heart from sin set free
a heart that is sprinkled with the blood
so freely she would for me

a heart resigned submissive meek
my great redeemer's throne
where only christ is heard to speak
where jesus reigns alone

a humble lowly contrite heart
believing true and clean
which neither life nor death can part
from him that dwells within

a heart in every thought renewed
and full of love divine
perfect and right and pure and good â€”
a copy lord of thine

thy nature gracious lord impart
come quickly from above
write thy new name upon my heart
thy new best name of love
