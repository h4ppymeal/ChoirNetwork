we read of a place that is called heaven
it is made for the pure and the free
these truths in god’s word he hath given
how beautiful heaven must be

    how beautiful heaven must be
    sweet home of the happy and free
    fair haven of rest for the weary
    how beautiful heaven must be

in heaven no drooping nor pining
no wishing for elsewhere to be
god’s light is forever there shining
how beautiful heaven must be

i am longing to go to fair heaven 
to be with the happpy an free
to spend the long ages in singing 
how beautiful heaven must be

the angels so sweetly are singing
up there by the beautiful sea
sweet chords from their gold harps are ringing
how beautiful heaven must be
