tell me the old old story 
of unseen things above
of jesus and his glory 
of jesus and his love

    tell me the story simply 
    as to a little child
    for i am weak and weary 
    and helpless and defiled

tell me the story slowly 
that i may take it in 
that wonderful redemption
god's remedy for sin
tell me the story often
for i forget so soon
the early dew of morning
has passed away at noon

tell me the story softly
with the earnest tones and grave
remember i am the sinner
whom god came to save
tell me the story always 
if you would really be
in any timw of trouble
a comforter to me

tell me the same old story
when you have because to fear
that this world's empty glory 
is costing me too dear
yes and when that world's glory 
is dawning on my soul tell me the old story
christ jesus make thee whole
