jesus shall reign where'er the sun
does its successive journeys run
his kingdom stretch from shore to shore
till moons shall wax and wane no more

to him shall endless prayer be made
and praises throng to crown his head
his name like sweet perfume shall rise
with every morning sacrifice

people and realms of every tongue
dwell on his love with sweetest song
and infant voices shall proclaim
their early blessings on his name

blessings abound where'er he reigns
the prisoners leap to lose their chains
the weary find eternal rest
and all who suffer want are blest

let every creature rise and bring
the highest honors to our king
angels descend with songs again
and earth repeat the loud amen
