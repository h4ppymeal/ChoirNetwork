never be sad or desponding
if thou hast faith to believe
grace for the duties before thee
ask of thy god and receive

    never give up never give up
    never give up to thy sorrows
    jesus will bid them depart
    trust in the lord trust in the lord
    sing when your trials are greatest
    trust in the lord and take heart

what if thy burdens oppress thee
what though thy life may be drear
look on the side that is brightest
pray and thy path will be clear

never be sad or desponding
there is a morrow for thee
soon thou shalt dwell in its brightness
there with the lord thou shalt be

never be sad or desponding
lean on the arm of thy lord
dwell in the depths of his mercy
thou shalt receive thy reward
