christ is the way the truth the life
the way to god on high

a prophet full of light
a priest that stands 'twixt god and man
a king that rules with might

christ's manhood is a temple where
the altar god doth rest
my christ he is the sacrifice
my christ he is the priest

my christ he is the lord of lords
he is the king of kings
he is the sun of righteousness
with healing in his wings

my christ he is the tree of life
which in god's garden grows
whose fruit does feed whose leaves do heal
my christ is sharon's rose

christ is my meat christ is my drink
my physic and my health
my peace my strength my joy my crown
my glory and my wealth

christ is my father and my friend
my brother and my love

my advocate above

my christ he is the heaven of heavens
my christ what shall i call
my christ is first my christ is last
my christ is all in all
