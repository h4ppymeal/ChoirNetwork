o what a wonderful wonderful day –
day i will never forget
after i would wandered in darkness away
jesus my saviour i met
o what a tender compassionate friend –
he met the need of my heart
shadows dispelling with joy i am telling
he made all the darkness depart

    heaven came down and glory filled my soul
    when at the cross the saviour made me whole
    my sins were washed away
    and my night was turned to day –
    heaven came down and glory filled my soul

born of the spirit with life from above
into god's fam'ly divine
justified fully thru calvary's love
o what a standing is mine
and the transaction so quickly was made
when as a sinner i came
took of the offer of grace he did proffer –
he saved me o praise his dear name

now i have a hope that will surely endure
after the passing of time
i have a future in heaven for sure
there in those mansions sublime
and it is because of that wonderful day
when at the cross i believed
riches eternal and blessings supernal
from his precious hand i received
