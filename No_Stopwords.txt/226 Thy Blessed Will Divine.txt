i want my life to be all filled with praise to thee
my precious lord divine who died for me
let all my will be thine controlled by love divine
live out in me thy life o mighty saviour

    thy blessed will divine with joy i make it mine
    my heart shall be thy throne and thine alone
    choose thou the path i tread and whither i am led
    help me to follow on o mighty saviour

a pilgrim born anew a stranger going through
not of this world am i since i am thine
weaned from its passing show transformed thy love to know
hold thou my hand in thine o mighty saviour

when evil foes assail and almost would prevail
in that dark hour be thou my strength and shield
lend then thy strong embrace uphold me by thy grace
in weakness be my strength o mighty saviour

yea choose the path for me although i may not see
the reason thou dost will to lead me so
i know the toilsome way will lead to realms of day
where i shall dwell with thee o mighty saviour
