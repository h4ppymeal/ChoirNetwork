blessed assurance jesus is mine
oh what a foretaste of glory divine
heir of salvation purchase of god
born of his spirit washed in his blood

    this is my story this is my song
    praising my saviour all the day long
    this is my story this is my song
    praising my saviour all the day long

perfect submission perfect delight
visions of rapture now burst on my sight
angels descending bring from above
echoes of mercy whispers of love

perfect submission all is at rest
i in my saviour am happy and blest
watching and waiting looking above
filled with his goodness lost in his love
