peace perfect peace in this dark world of sin
the blood of jesus whispers peace within

peace perfect peace by thronging duties pressed
to do the will of jesus this is rest

peace perfect peace with sorrows surging round
on jesus' bosom naught but calm is found

peace perfect peace with loved ones far away
in jesus' keeping we are safe and they

peace perfect peace our future all unknown
jesus we know and he is on the throne

peace perfect peace death shadowing us and ours
jesus has vanquished death and all its powers

it is enough earth's struggles soon shall cease
and jesus call us to heaven's perfect peace
