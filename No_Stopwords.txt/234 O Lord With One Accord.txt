o lord with one accord 
we gather round thy holy throne
to worship the alone
now send from heaven the holy ghost
be this another pentecost

we have no strength to meet 
the storms that round us lower 
keep thou our trembling feet
in evry trying hour
more than victorious shall we be
if girded with thy panoply

where is the mighty wind that
shook the holy place that gladdened
every mind and brightened every face 
and where the cloven tongues of flames
that marked each follower of the lamb

there is no chance in thee lord god the holy ghost
thy glorious majesty is as a pentecost
o may our loosened tongues proclaim 
that thou our god art still the same

and may the living wave that issues from on high
whose golden waters lave thy eternally 
flow doen in power on us today 
and none shall go unblessed away

anoint us with thy grace to yield ourselves to thee
to run our daily grace with joy and energy 
until we hear the bridegroom say 
rise up my love and come and stay
