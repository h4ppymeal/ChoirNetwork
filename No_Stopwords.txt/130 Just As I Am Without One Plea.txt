just as i am without one plea
but that thy blood was she would for me
and that thou bid'st me come to thee
o lamb of god i come i come

just as i am and waiting not
to rid my soul of one dark blot
to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
o lamb of god i come i come

just as i am though tossed about
with many a conflict many a doubt
fightings within and fears without
o lamb of god i come i come

just as i am poor wretched blind
sight riches healing of the mind
yes all i need in thee to find
o lamb of god i come i come

just as i am thou wilt receive
wilt welcome pardon cleanse relieve
because thy promise i believe
o lamb of god i come i come

just as i am thy love unknown
has broken every barrier down
now to be thine yea thine alone
o lamb of god i come i come

just as i am of that free love
the breadth length depth and height to prove
here for a season then above
o lamb of god i come i come
