from ev'ry stormy wind that blows
from ev'ry swelling tide of woes
there is a calm a sure retreat
it is found beneath the mercy seat

there is a place where jesus sheds
the oil of gladness on our heads
a place than all besides more sweet
it is the bloodstained mercy seat

there is a spot where spirits blend
where friend holds fellowship with friend
though' sundered far by faith they meet
around the common mercy seat

ah whither could we flee for aid
when tempted desolate dismayed
or how the hosts of hell defeat
had suff'ring saints no mercy seat

there there on eagle wings we soar
and time and sense seem all no more
and heav'n comes down our souls to greet
and glory crowns the mercy seat

o may my hand forget her skill
my tongue be silent cold and still
this bounding heart forget to beat
if i forget the mercy seat
