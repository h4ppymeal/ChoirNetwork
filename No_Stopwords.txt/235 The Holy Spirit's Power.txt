the holy spirit's power
ye need th master said so wait till comes 
the hours when on you he is she would so praise
did all their soul employ as tarried they 
with fervent joy

and when ten days were passed
with one accord were they
heaven's window long closed fast
were opened on that day
with rushing mighty wind and flame
the promised holy ghost came

their loosened tongues were filled
with strange and wondrous words
heaven's life their hearts has thrilled
god's goodness they declared
and unto all th' apostle said 
is the gift since christ has bled

come now ye sons of men this message now received 
the holy spirit given to all believe
ye too may know his mighty power
and speak with tongues this very hour

then charity divine
your yaerning hearts shall fill
t'wards those who now repine 
held in sin's bondage still 
for these your zeal shall never tire
to snatch them from the everlsating fire
