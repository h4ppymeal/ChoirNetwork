“almost persuaded” now to believe
“almost persuaded” christ to receive
seems now some soul to say
“go spirit go thy way
some more convenient day
on thee i will call”

“almost persuaded” come come today
“almost persuaded” turn not away
jesus invites you here
angels are ling’ring near
prayers rise from hearts so dear
o wand’rer come

oh be persuaded christ never fails—
oh be persuaded his blood avails—
can save from every sin
cleanse you without within—
will you not let him in
open the door

“almost persuaded” harvest is past
“almost persuaded” doom comes at last
“almost” cannot avail
“almost” is but to fail
sad sad that bitter wail—
“almost—but lost”

be now persuaded oh sinner hear
be now persuaded jesus is near
his voice is pleading still
turn now with heart and will
peace will your spirit fill—
oh turn today
