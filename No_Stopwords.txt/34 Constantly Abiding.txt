there is a peace in my heart
that the world never gave
a peace it cannot take away
though the trials of life
may surround like a cloud
i have a peace that has come here to stay

    constantly abiding jesus is mine
    constantly abiding rapture divine
    he never leaves me lonely
    whispers o so kind
    i will never leave thee jesus is mine

all the world seemed to sing
of a savior and king
when peace sweetly came to my heart
troubles all fled away
and my night turned to day
blessed jesus how glorious thou art

this treasure i have
in a temple of clay
while here on his footstool i roam
but he is coming to take
me some glorious day
over there to my heavenly home
