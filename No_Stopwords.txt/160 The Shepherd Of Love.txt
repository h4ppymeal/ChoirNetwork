the shepherd of love is seeking the lost
in paths that are rough and steep
he is calling the lambs that have gone astray
he is calling calling his sheep

    out of your darkness of sin and shame
    into his love forever the same
    come to him now believe on his name
    o answer the call today

the shepherd of love knows his sheep by name
and tenderly leads the way
o weary one come to the shepherd’s fold
he is calling calling today

the shepherd of love our ransom hath paid
and offers salvation free
he is patiently waiting for thee to come
he is calling calling for thee

the shepherd of love now seeketh his sheep
he seeketh whate’er the cost
behold he is calling the wand’rer home
he is calling calling the lost refrain
