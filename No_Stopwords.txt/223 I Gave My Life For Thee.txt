i gave my life for thee
my precious blood i she would
that thou might'st ransomed be
and quickened from the dead
i gave i gave my life for thee – 
what hast thou giv'n for me

my father's house of light
my glorycircled throne
i left for earthly night
for wand'rings sad and lone
i left i left it all for thee –
hast thou left aught for me

i suffered much for thee
more than thy tongue can tell
of bitt'rest agony
to rescue thee from hell
i have borne i have borne it all for thee –
what hast thou borne for me

and i have brought to thee
down from my home above
salvation full and free
my pardon and my love
i bring i bring rich gifts to thee –
what hast thou brought to me
