marvellous grace of our loving lord
grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt
yonder on calvary's mount outpoured
there where the blood of the lamb was split

    grace grace god's grace
    grace that will pardon and cleanse within
    grace grace god's grace
    grace that is greater than all our sin

sin and despair like the sea waves cold
threaten the soul with infinite loss
grace that is greater yes grace untold
points to the refuge the mighty cross

dark is the stain that we cannot hide
what can avail to wash it away
look there is flowing a crimson tide
whiter than snow you may be today

marvellous infinite matchless grace
freely bestowed on all who believe
you that are longing to see his face
will you this moment his grace receive
