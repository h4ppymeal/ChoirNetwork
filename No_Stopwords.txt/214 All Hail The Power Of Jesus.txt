all hail the power of jesus' name
let angels prostrate fall
bring forth the royal diadem
and crown him lord of all
bring forth the royal diadem
and crown him lord of all

o seed of israel's chosen race
now ransomed from the fall
hail him who saves you by his grace
and crown him lord of all
hail him who saves you by his grace
and crown him lord of all

let every tongue and every tribe
responsive to his call
to him all majesty ascribe
and crown him lord of all
to him all majesty ascribe
and crown him lord of all

oh that with all the sacred throng
we at his feet may fall
we will join the everlasting song
and crown him lord of all
we will join the everlasting song
and crown him lord of all
