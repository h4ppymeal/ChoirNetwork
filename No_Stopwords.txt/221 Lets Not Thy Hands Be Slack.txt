let not thy hands be slack
live not in vain
out on life's lonely track
men toil in pain
play thou a brother's part
strength love and hope impart
bid thou the fainting heart
look up again

let not thy hands be slack
grip thou thy sword
why should'st thou courage lack
think of the lord
did he not fight for thee
stronger than all is he
and he thy strength will be
rest on his word

let not thy hands be slack
haste to the fray
dream not of turning back
life is not play
gird thou thy armor on
fight till the battle's won
then shall thy lord's well done
more than repay

let not thy hands be slack
fear not be strong
cease not to make attack
on ev'ry wrong
press on for truth and right
hold high the gospel light
expel the dirge of night
with heaven's song

let not thy hands be slack
the days fly fast
lost moments come not back
from the dark past
then be not slack of hand
help thou the weak to stand
to god and fatherland
give all thou hast
