    "Instructions\n",
    " 1. Process the Text\n",
    " - Convert to Lowercase\n",
    " - Remove Punctuation & Numbers\n",
    " - Tokenization (Splitting text into individual words or tokens)\n",
    " - Removing Stop Words (e.g. \"and\", \"the\", \"of\")\n",
    " - Stemming/Lemmatization (reducing words to their base/root form) *optional\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Vectorize Text\n",
    " - Convert text into numerical format using TF-IDF or embeddings\n",
    " - TF-IDF weights the words based on their frequency in a document against their frequency across all documents\n",
    " - Word embeddings using Word2Vec, CloVe, or FastText can be used to convert words into vectors (better)\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Dimensionality Reduction with t-SNE\n",
    " - Choosing parameters (starting point 5 - 50, learning rate 10-1000)\n",
    " - Scaling - Might need to scae feature vectors before applying (MinMAxScaler or StandardScaler)\n",
    " - Applying t-SNE to reduce dimensionality of vectorized hymns (from scikit-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Visualization\n",
    " - Plotting (Matplotlib) to create a scatter plot of 2D points\n",
    " - Enhancements to make visualization more informative (optional?)"
