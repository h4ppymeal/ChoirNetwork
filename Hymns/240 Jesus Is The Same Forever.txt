Jesus Is The Same Forever
As Of Old, So Now Today;
All The Host Of Hell Endeavour
Vainly To Obstruct His Sway,
In His People’s Hearts He
Reigneth,
Finishes What He Begins;
Jesus Still “All Power”
Retaineth,
Saves His People From Their
Sins.

Jesus Is The Same Forever;
Yes, He Heals The Sick Today,
As Of Old, So Now, He Never
Turns One Suffering Child Away,
He Can Cure The Worst Diseases,
For He Understands Our Frame;
Bore Our Griefs, And So Releases
All Who Dare Their Rights To Claim.

Jesus Is The Same Forever;
Still He Says “In Me Abide,”
From His Ha No Power Can Sever
Those Who In Their Lord Confide,
Sweetly From All Care He Frees Us,
Ours The Comfort His The Shame
Blessed Saviour; Precious Jesus
There’s No Music Like Thy Name.
