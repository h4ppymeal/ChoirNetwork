"Must I go and empty-handed,"
Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His feet?

    "Must I go, and empty-handed?"
    Must I meet my Saviour so?
    Not one soul with which to greet Him,
    Must I empty-handed go?

Not at death I shrink nor falter,
For my Saviour saves me now;
But to meet Him empty-handed,
Thought of that now clouds my brow.

O the years in sinning wasted,
Could I but recall them now;
I would give them to my Saviour,
To His will I'd gladly bow.

O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,
Up and work while yet 'tis day;
Ere the night of death o'ertake thee,
Strive for souls while still you may.
