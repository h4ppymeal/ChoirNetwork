Christ Jesus hath the power, the power to forgive,
The pow'r to quicken whom He will and make the sinner live.
Christ Jesus hath the pow'r, O tell it far and near!
O bring to Him your guilty heart, and grace shall banish fear!

    Christ Jesus hath the pow'r, 
    the pow'r of God He wields!
    Christ Jesus hath the pow'r,
     my heart surrender yields!
    Christ Jesus hath the pow'r,
    I trust Him evermore!
    Christ Jesus hath the pow'r,
    I worship and adore!

Christ Jesus hath the pow'r, the power to renew,
The pow'r to cleanse your heart from sin, and make you wholly true.
Christ Jesus hath the pow'r for evermore to keep:
O none can pluck you from His hand or rob Him of His sheep!

Christ Jesus hath the pow'r, the power to console,
The pow'r to carry all your care - on Him your burdens roll.
Christ Jesus hath the pow'r to wipe the tear away:
O place in Him your confidence! O trust Him and obey!

Christ Jesus hath the pow'r, the power to destroy,
The pow'r to bruise your enemy, who would your soul annoy.
Christ Jesus hath the pow'r, when on your dying bed,
To give your soul the victory, the pow'r to raise the dead!
