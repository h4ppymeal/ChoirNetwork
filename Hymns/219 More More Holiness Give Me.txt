More holiness give me, 
More striving within;
More patience in suff'ring,
More sorrow for sin;
More faith in my Savior,
More sense of His care.
More joy in His service, 
More purpose in prayer.

More gratitude give me, 
More trust in the Lord;
More pride in His glory, 
More hope in His word;
More tears for His sorrows, 
More pain at His grief;
More meekness in trial, 
More praise for relief.

More purity give me, 
More strength to o’ercome;
More freedom from earth-stains,
More longings for home;
More fit for the kingdom, 
More used would I be;
More blessèd and holy, 
More, Savior, like Thee.
