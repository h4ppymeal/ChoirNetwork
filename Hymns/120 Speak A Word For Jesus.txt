Speak just a word for Jesus,
Tell how he died for you;
Often repeat the story,
Wonderful, glad, and true!

    Speak just a word,
    Ever to Him be true;
    Speak just a word,
    Tell what He's doing for you!

Speak just a word for Jesus,
Tell how He helps you live;
Tell of the strength and comfort
Which He will freely give! 

Speak just a word for Jesus,
Do not for others wait;
Gladly proclaim the message
Soon it will be too late! 

Speak just a word for Jesus,
Why should you doubt or fear?
Surely His love will bless it;
Some one will gladly hear. 

Speak just a word for Jesus,
Tell of His love for men!
Some one distressed may listen,
Willing to trust Him then.
