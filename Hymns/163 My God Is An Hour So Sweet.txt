My God, is any hour so sweet
From blush of morn to evening star,
As that which calls me to Thy feet,
The hour of prayer?

Then is my strength by Thee renewed;
Then are my sins by Thee forgiv’n;
Then dost Thou cheer my solitude
With hopes of heav’n.

No words can tell what sweet relief
There for my ev'ry want I find.
What strength for warfare, balm for grief,
What peace of mind!

Hushed is each doubt, gone ev'ry fear;
My spirit seems in heav’n to stay;
And e’en the penitential tear
Is wiped away.

Lord, till I reach yon blissful shore,
No privilege so dear shall be
As thus my inmost soul to pour
In prayer to thee.
