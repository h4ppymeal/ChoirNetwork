I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining everyday;
Still praying as I onward bound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

    Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
    By faith on heaven's table land;
    A higher plane than I have found,
    Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise, and fears dismay;
Tho' some may dwell where these abound,
My pray'r my aim is higher ground.

I want to live above the world,
Though Satan's darts at me are hurled
But still I'll pray till heav'n I've found:
"Lord, lead me on to higher ground."

I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.
