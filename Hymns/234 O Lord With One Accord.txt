O Lord "with one accord" 
we gather round Thy holy throne
to worship the alone.
Now send from heaven the Holy ghost
Be this another Pentecost

We have no strength to meet 
The storms that round us lower, 
keep thou our trembling feet
In evry trying hour;
More than victorious shall we be
if girded with Thy panoply

Where is the mighty wind That
shook the holy place that gladdened
every mind and brightened every face? 
And where the cloven tongues of flames
That marked each follower of the Lamb?

There is no chance in Thee, Lord God the Holy Ghost,
Thy glorious majesty Is as a Pentecost!
O may our loosened tongues proclaim 
That Thou our God art still the same

And may the living wave That issues from on high,
whose golden waters lave thy eternally 
Flow doen in power on us to-day, 
And none shall go unblessed away

Anoint us with Thy grace, to yield ourselves to Thee
To run our daily grace with joy and energy 
until we hear the Bridegroom say, 
"Rise up my love and come and stay"
