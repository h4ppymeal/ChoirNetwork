Lord, as of old, at Pentecost,
Thou didst Thy pow’r display—
With cleansing, purifying flame,
Descend on us today.

    Lord, send the old-time power, the Pentecostal power!
    Thy floodgates of blessing, on us throw open wide!
    Lord, send the old-time power, the Pentecostal power!
    That sinners be converted and Thy Name glorified!

For mighty works for Thee, prepare
And strengthen every heart;
Come, take possession of Thine own,
And nevermore depart.

All self consume, all sin destroy!
With earnest zeal endue
Each waiting heart to work for Thee;
O Lord, our faith renew!

Speak, Lord! before Thy throne we wait,
Thy promise we believe,
And will not let Thee go until
The blessing we receive.
