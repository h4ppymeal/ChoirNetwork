Have you wandered away from your Father's care,
Heavy hearted and sad do you roam?
There's a sweet gentle voice calling now to you
Wand-ring child, wand'ring child, O come home.

    Child, come home, child come home,
    Wand'ring child, why longer roam?
    'Tis thy Father entreats
    Wand'ring child, O come home.

Is your frail bark adrift on life's raging sea,
Are you tossed on its billows and foam?
There's a safe harbor home, waiting now for you
Wand-ring child, wand'ring child, O come home. 

He is pleading today, heed His gentle voice,
As He bids you no longer to roam,
To that dear Father's house haste without delay--
Wand-ring child, wand'ring child, O come home.
