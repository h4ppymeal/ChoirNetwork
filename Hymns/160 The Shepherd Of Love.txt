The Shepherd of Love is seeking the lost
In paths that are rough and steep;
He’s calling the lambs that have gone astray,
He’s calling, calling His sheep.

    Out of your darkness of sin and shame,
    Into His love, forever the same,
    Come to Him now, believe on His name,
    O answer the call today.

The Shepherd of Love knows His sheep by name,
And tenderly leads the way;
O weary one, come to the Shepherd’s fold,
He’s calling, calling today.

The Shepherd of Love our ransom hath paid,
And offers salvation free;
He’s patiently waiting for thee to come,
He’s calling, calling for thee.

The Shepherd of Love now seeketh His sheep,
He seeketh whate’er the cost;
Behold, He is calling the wand’rer home,
He’s calling, calling the lost. [Refrain]
