Thou my everlasting Portion,
More than friend or life to me;
All along my pilgrim journey,
Saviour, let me walk with Thee.

    Close to Thee, close to Thee,
    Close to Thee, close to Thee;
    All along my pilgrim journey,
    Saviour, let me walk with Thee.

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Or for fame, my pray'r shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me thro' the vale of shadow;
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea;
Then the gate of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.

Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Then the gates of life eternal,
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.
