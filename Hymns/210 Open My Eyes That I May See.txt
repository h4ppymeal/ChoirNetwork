Open my eyes, that I may see
Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
Place in my hands the wonderful key
That shall unclasp and set me free.
 
Open my ears, that I may hear
Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
And while the wave notes fall on my ear,
Everything false will disappear.
 
Open my mouth, and let me bear,
Gladly the warm truth everywhere;
Open my heart and let me prepare
Love with Thy children thus to share.

Open my mind, that i may read 
more of thy love in word and deed 
what shall i fear while yet Thou dost  lead?
Only for light from Thee I plead
Silently now i wait for thee ready,my God 
thy will to see pen my mind, illuminate me,
Spirit divine!

Open my way, that i may bring
Trophies of grace to Thee, my King
Echoed in love Thy word shall out ring
Sweet as the note that angels sing 
Silently now i wait for thee
Ready, my God, Thy will to see
Open my way, illuminate me, Spirit Divine!
