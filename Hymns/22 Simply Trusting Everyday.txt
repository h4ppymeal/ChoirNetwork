Simply trusting every day;
Trusting through a stormy way;
Even when my faith is small,
Trusting Jesus, that is all

	Trusting as the moments fly,
	Trusting as the days go by,
	Trusting Him, whateâ€™er befall,
	Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Singing if my way be clear,
Praying if the path be drear;
If in danger, for Him call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Trusting Him while life shall last,
Trusting Him till earth is past,
Till His gracious advent call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.
