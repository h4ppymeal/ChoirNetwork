Many a soul in the battle of life
Trembles with fear at the din and the strife,
Bearing alone, amid trial and care,
Burdens and sorrows God bids you to share.

    Do something for others,
    Something for others today!
    Duty demands it,
    And Jesus commands it!
    Do something for others today

Many in doubt or in fear of the way,
Mutely appeal for your guidance today;
On your demeanor the choice may depend—
Are you concerned for the stranger or friend? 

Many, disheartened by cruel deceit,
Broken and worn by the pangs of defeat,
Doubting, despairingly, helplessly stand,
Waiting, perhaps, for your strengthening hand.

Many are turning away from the right
Into the maze of the shadows of night;
Go to them, speak to them, over them pray,
Help them, support them—do something today. [Refrain]
