Jesus may come today,
Glad day, glad day!
And I would see my Friend;
Dangers and troubles would end
If Jesus should come today.

    Glad day, glad day!
    Is it the crowning day?
    I’ll live for today, nor anxious be;
    Jesus, my Lord I soon shall see;
    Glad day, glad day!
    Is it the crowning day?

I may go home today,
Glad day, glad day!
Seemeth I hear their song,
Hail to the radiant throng,
If I should go home today.

Why should I anxious be?
Glad day, glad day!
Lights appear on the shore,
Storms will affright nevermore,
For He is “at hand” today.

Faithful I’ll be today,
Glad day, glad day!
And I will freely tell
Why I should love Him so well,
For He is my all today.
