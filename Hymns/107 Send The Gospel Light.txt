Send the gospel of salvation, 
to a world of dying men; 
tell it out to every nation, 
'til the Lord shall come again. 

    Go and tell them, go and tell them, 
    Jesus died for sinful men. 
    Go and tell them, go and tell them, 
    He is coming, He is coming, 
    He is coming back again. 

'This the church's great commission, 
'This the Master's last command; 
Christ has died for every creature, 
tell it out in every land. 

Christ is gathering out a people 
to His name from every race; 
haste to give the invitation 
ere shall end the day of grace. 

Give the gospel as a witness 
to a world of sinful men; 
till the Bride shall be completed, 
and the Lord shall come again
