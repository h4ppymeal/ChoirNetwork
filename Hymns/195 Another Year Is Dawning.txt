Another year is dawning, dear Father let it be,
In working or in waiting, another year with Thee;
Another year of progress, another year of praise,
Another year of proving Thy presence all the days.

Another year of mercies, another year of grace;
Another year of gladness, the glory of Thy face;
Another year of leaning upon Thy loving breast;
Another year of trusting, of quiet, happy rest.

Another year of service, of witness for Thy love;
Another year of training for holier work above;
Another year is dawning! Dear Father, let it be,
On earth, or else in heaven, another year for Thee.
