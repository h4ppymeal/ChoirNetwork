All, all to Jesus, I consecrate anew;
He is my portion forever,
Only His glory henceforth will I pursue:
He is my portion forever.

    Take, take the world, with all its gilded toys,
    Take, take the world, I covet not its joys,
    Mine is a wealth no moth nor rust destroys;
    He is my portion forever.

All, all to Jesus, my trusting heart can say:
He is my portion forever.
Led by His mercy, I'm walking ev'ry day:
He is my portion forever.

Though He may try me, this blessed truth I know:
He is my portion forever,
He will not leave me, His promise tells me so;
He is my portion forever.

All, all to Jesus, I cheerfully resign:
He is my portion forever;
I have the witness that He, my Lord, is mine;
He is my portion forever.
