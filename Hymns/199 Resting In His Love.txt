God has shown His loving face
From His throne in heav'n above;
And I've found a resting-place,
In the shelter of his love

    I am resting, resting,
    Resting in His love; I am resting in His love,
    Resting in the shelter of His love.

What the care of his life oppress 
When the sky is dark above;
I can always find rest 
In the shelter of His Love

O, If you were never blest,
with this peace from heaven above;
There's for you a wonderous rest, 
In the shelter of his love
