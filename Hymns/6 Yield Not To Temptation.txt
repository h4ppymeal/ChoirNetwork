Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin;
Each victory will help you some other to win;
Fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue;
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.

    Ask the Saviour to help you;
    Comfort, strengthen and keep you;
    He's willing to aid you,
    He will carry you through.

Shun evil companions, bad language disdain;
God's name hold in reverence, nor take it in vain;
Be thoughtful and earnest, kind-hearted and true;
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.

To him that o'ercometh, God giveth a crown;
Through faith we will conquer, though often cast down;
He who is our Saviour, our strength will renew;
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.
