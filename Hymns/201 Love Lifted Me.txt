I was sinking deep in sin,
far from the peaceful shore,
very deeply stained within,
sinking to rise no more;
but the Master of the sea
heard my despairing cry,
from the waters lifted me;
now safe am I. 

    Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 
    When nothing else could help,
    Love lifted me.
    Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 
    When nothing else could help,
    Love lifted me.

All my heart to Him i give
Ever to Him I'll cling in His presence live
Ever His praises sing,
Love so mighty and so true 
merits my soul's best songs 
Faithful, loving service too,
to him belongs

Souls in danger, look above,
Jesus completely saves;
he will lift you by his love
out of the angry waves.
Heâ€™s the Master of the sea,
billows his will obey;
he your Savior wants to be -
be saved today. [Refrain]
