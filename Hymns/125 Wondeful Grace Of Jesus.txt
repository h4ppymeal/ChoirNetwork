Wonderful Grace of Jesus, greater than all my sin;
How shall my tongue describe it,
Where shall its praise begin?
Taking away my burden, setting my spirit free;
O the Wonderful Grace of Jesus reaches me!

    Wonderful the matchless Grace of Jesus,
    the matchless Grace of Jesus,
    Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;
    the rolling sea;
    Wonderful Grace, all sufficient for me, for even
    Higher than the mountain, sparkling like a fountain,
    All sufficient Grace for even me.
    Broader than the scope of my transgressions,
    sing it!
    Greater far than all my sin and shame
    my sin and shame,
    O magnify the precious name of Jesus,
    PRAISE HIS NAME!

Wonderful Grace of Jesus, reaching to all the lost;
By it I have been pardoned, saved to the uttermost.
Chains have been torn asunder, giving me liberty;
O the Wonderful Grace of Jesus, reaches me!

Wonderful Grace of Jesus, reaching the most defiled;
By its transforming power,
Making me God's dear child,
Purchasing peace and Heaven, for all eternity;
And the Wonderful Grace of Jesus, reaches me!
