Saviour, like a Shepherd, lead us,
Much we need Thy tender care;
In Thy pleasant pastures feed us,
For our use Thy folds prepare;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us Thine we are;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us Thine we are.

We are Thine, do Thou befriend us,
Be the Guardian of our way;
Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us,
Seek us when we go astray;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Hear, O hear us when we pray;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Hear, O hear us when we pray,

Thou has promised to receive us,
Poor and sinful though we be;
Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
Grace to cleanse and pow'r to free;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Early let us turn to Thee;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Early let us turn to Thee.

Early let us seek Thy favour,
Early let us do Thy will;
Blessed Lord and only Saviour
With Thy love our bosoms fill;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Thou hast loved us, love us still;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Thou hast loved us, love us still.

Like a Shepherd come receive us
When Thou comest in the air;
In Thine arms wilt Thou now take us
To that joyful union there;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
In that land beyond compare;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
In that land beyond compare.
