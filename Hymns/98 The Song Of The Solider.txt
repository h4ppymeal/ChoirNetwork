Rise, ye children of salvation,
All who cleave to Christ the Head;
Wake, arise, O mighty nation,
Ere the foe on Zion tread.

    Pour it forth a mighty anthem,
    Pour it forth a mighty anthem,
    Like the thunders of the sea;
    Through the blood of Christ our ransom,
    More than conquerors are we,
    More than conquerors are we,
    More than conquerors are we;
    Through the blood of Christ our ransom,
    More than conquerors are we.

Saints, and heroes long before us
Firmly on this ground have stood;
See their banners waving o’er us,
Conquerors though Jesus’ blood.

Deathless, we are all unfearing,
Life laid up with Christ in God;
In the morn of His appearing
Floweth forth, a glory flood. 

Soon we all shall stand before Him,
See and know our glorious Lord;
Soon in joy and light adore Him,
Each receiving his reward.
