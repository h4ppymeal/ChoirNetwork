I've found the pearl of greatest price,
My heart doth sing for joy:
And sing I must, a Christ I have;
O what a Christ have I?

Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life,
The way to God on high,
Life to the dead, the truth of types,
The truth of prophesy.

Christ is a prophet, priest and king,
A Prophet full of light,
A Priest that stands 'twixt God and man,
A King that rules with might.

Christ's manhood is a temple, where
The altar God doth rest;
My Christ, he is the sacrifice,
My Christ he is the priest.

My Christ he is the Lord of lords,
He is the King of kings;
He is the Sun of righteousness,
With healing in his wings.

My Christ, he is the Tree of Life,
Which in God's garden grows;
Whose fruit does feed, whose leaves do heal;
My Christ is Sharon's rose.

Christ is my meat, Christ is my drink,
My physic and my health,
My peace, my strength, my joy, my crown,
My glory and my wealth.

Christ is my father, and my friend,
My brother and my love;
My head, my hope, my counselor,
My advocate above.

My Christ, he is the Heaven of heavens,
My Christ what shall I call?
My Christ is first, my Christ is last,
My Christ is all in all.
