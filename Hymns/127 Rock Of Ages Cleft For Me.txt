Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and pow'r.

Not the labour of my hand
Can fulfil Thy law's demand;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone,
Thou must save and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hands I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked come to Thee for dress,
Helpless look to Thee for grace,
Foul I to the fountain fly,
Cleanse me, Saviour, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes are closed in death;
While I soar through tracks unknown, 
See Thee on Thy judgement throne,
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
