Tell me the old, old story 
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory, 
Of Jesus and His love.

    Tell me the story simply, 
    As to a little child;
    For I am weak and weary, 
    And helpless and defiled.

Tell me the story slowly, 
That I may take it in -
That wonderful redemption,
God's remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often,
For I forget so soon;
The early dew of morning
Has passed away at noon.

Tell me the story softly,
With the earnest tones and grave
Remember I'm the sinner
Whom God came to save
Tell me the story always 
If you would really be,
In any timw of trouble
A comforter to me

Tell me the same old story
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory 
Is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world's glory 
is dawning on my soul Tell me the old story
Christ Jesus make thee whole
