Who'll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who’ll be the next his cross to bear?
Someone is ready, someone is waiting;
Who’ll be the next a crown to wear?

    Who’ll be the next, who’ll be the next?
    Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
    Who’ll be the next to follow les us now?
    Follow Jesus now?

Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
Come and bow at his precious feet;
Who’ll be the next to lay every burden
Down at the Father’s mercy seat?

Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus?
Who’ll be the next to praise his name?
Who’ll swell the chorus of free redemption,
Sing hallelujah, praise the Lamb?

Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus
Down through the Jordan’s rolling tide?
Who’ll be the next to join with the ransomed
Singing upon the other side?
