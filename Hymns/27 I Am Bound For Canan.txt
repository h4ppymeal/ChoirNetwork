Storms do not alarm me, they sometime must cease,
Trials cannot harm me, for I have blessed peace;
All I've left behind me, I long for no more,
Better things shall find me on Canaan's shore.

    Let those who will stay in Egypt land,
    I am bound for Canaan,
    Where milk and honey flowing, shall every need supply;
    All battles fought and the victory won,
    Peace and joy my portion,
    My soul shall rest on its shore by and by.

Troubles do not fret me, they cannot abide,
Though they may beset me, in Jesus, I will hide,
All the world's commotion about me may roam,
There's no stormy ocean on Canaan's shore.

I in grace abiding, am trying to stay,
In the shadow hiding of Canaan's perfect day;
All I trust may fail me, 'twill matter no more,
Nothing can assail me on Canaan's shore.
