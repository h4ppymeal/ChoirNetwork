Have you any room for Jesus,
He who bore your load of sin?
As He knocks and asks admission,
Sinner, will you let Him in?

    Room for Jesus, King of Glory!
    Hasten now, His Word obey.
    Swing the heart’s door widely open;
    Bid Him enter while you may.

Room for pleasure, room for business;
But for Christ, the Crucified,
Not a place that He can enter,
In the heart for which He died? 

Have you any room for Jesus, 
Soon will pass God's day of grace 
Soon thy heart left cold and silent
And thy saviour pleading cease

Room and time now give to Jesus;
Soon will pass God’s day of grace -
Soon your heart left cold and silent,
And your Savior’s pleading cease.
