We read of a place that’s called heaven,
It’s made for the pure and the free;
These truths in God’s Word He hath given,
How beautiful heaven must be.

    How beautiful heaven must be,
    Sweet home of the happy and free;
    Fair haven of rest for the weary,
    How beautiful heaven must be.

In heaven no drooping nor pining,
No wishing for elsewhere to be;
God’s light is forever there shining,
How beautiful heaven must be.

I'm longing to go to fair heaven, 
To be with the happpy an free
To spend the long ages in singing 
How beautiful heaven must be

The angels so sweetly are singing,
Up there by the beautiful sea;
Sweet chords from their gold harps are ringing,
How beautiful heaven must be.
