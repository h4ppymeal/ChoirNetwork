Faith of our fathers living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword,
O how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word.

    Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
    We will be true to Thee till death.

Faith of our fathers, we will strive
To win all nations unto Thee,
And through the truth that comes from God
Mankind shall then be truly free.

Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife,
And preach Thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life.
