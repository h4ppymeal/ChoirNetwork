Sinners Jesus will receive: 
Sound this word of grace to all 
Who the heav'nly pathway leave, 
All who linger, all who fall.

    Sing it o'er.. and o'er again...
    Christ receiv..eth sinful men...
    Make the mes..sages clear and plain
    Christ receiv...eth sinful me
    
Come and He will give you rest; 
Trust Him for His word is plain; 
He will take the sinfulest; 
Christ receiveth sinful men.

Now my heart condemns me not, 
Pure before the law I stand; 
He who cleansed me from all spot 
Satisfied its last demand.

Christ receiveth sinful men, 
Even me with all my sin; 
Purged from ev’ry spot and stain, 
Heav’n with Him I enter in.
