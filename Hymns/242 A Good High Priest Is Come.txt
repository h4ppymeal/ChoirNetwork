A good High Priest is come,
supplying Aaron's place,
and taking up his room,
dispensing life and grace;
the law by Aaron's priesthood came,
but grace and truth by Jesus' name.

He once temptations knew 
of every sort and kind,
that He might succor show
to every tempted mind;
in every point the Lamb was tried
like us, and then for us He died.

He died, but lives again,
and by the throne He stands,
there shows how He was slain,
opening His pierc√®d hands;
our Priest abides and pleads the cause
of us who have transgressed His laws.

I other priests disclaim,
and laws and off'rings too;
none but the bleeding Lamb
the mighty work can do;
He shall have all the praise: for He 
has loved, and died, and lives for me.
