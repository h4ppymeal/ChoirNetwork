The holy Spirit's power
Ye need th master said "So wait till comes 
the hours when on you He is shed so praise
did all their soul employ as tarried they 
with fervent joy

And when ten days were passed
With one accord were they,
Heaven's window long closed fast,
were opened on that day
with rushing mighty wind and flame
The promised Holy Ghost came

Their loosened tongues were filled
with strange and wondrous words;
Heaven's life their hearts has thrilled,
God's goodness they declared;
"And unto all, "th' Apostle said, 
"Is the gift, since Christ has bled."

Come now, ye sons of men This message now received ,
The holy spirit given To all believe;
Ye, too, may know His mighty power,
And speak with tongues this very hour.

Then charity divine
Your yaerning hearts shall fill
T'wards those who now repine, 
Held in sin's bondage still; 
For these your zeal shall never tire
To snatch them from the everlsating fire.
