I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

    I need Thee, oh, I need Thee,
    Every hour I need Thee,
    Oh, bless me now, my Saviour,
    I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour,
Stay Thou nearby;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

I need Thee every hour,
Teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfil.

I need Thee every hour,
Most Holy One;
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son!
