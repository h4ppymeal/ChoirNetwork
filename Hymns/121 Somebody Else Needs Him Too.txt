If you've found Jesus 
the friend  that you
need if He is loving and true,
if you  have found him a saviour indeed,
Somebody else needs him too

    Somebody somewhere perhaps at you side
    somewhere is waiting for you Say  that 
    for all jesus suffered and died; they needs him 
    they need him too

If you are happy, and praise fills your heart,
Trust him to carry you through 
if He His Spirit and love can
impart Somebody else needs Him too..

If you have comfort in being God's child
If he is faithful to you Think when you see those whom
sin has defiled Somebody else needs Him, tooo..

When the lord gives you His love and grace 
somethings he give you to do;
you have the gospel  with others to share
somebody needs him too...
