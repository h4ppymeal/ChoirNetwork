'Tis finished! the Messiah dies, 
cut off for sins, but not his own. 
Accomplished is the sacrifice, 
the great redeeming work is done. 

The veil is rent; in Christ alone 
the living way to heaven is seen; 
the middle wall is broken down, 
and all the world may enter in. 

'Tis finished! All my guilt and pain, 
I want no sacrifice beside; 
for me, for me the Lamb is slain; 
'tis finished! I am justified. 

The reign of sin and death is o'er, 
and all may live from sin set free; 
Satan hath lost his mortal power; 
'tis swallowed up in victory.
