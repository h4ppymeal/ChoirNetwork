There is no love like the love of Jesus,
Never to fail or fall,
Till into the fold of the peace of God,
He has gathered us all.

    Jesus' love, precious love,
    Boundless and pure and free!
    Oh, turn to that love, weary, wand'ring soul,
    Jesus pleadeth for thee!

There is no eye like the eye of Jesus,
piercing so fa away; Ne'er out of the sight of  it's tender
light Can wanderer stray

There is no voice like the voice of Jesus,
Tender and sweet its chime 
Like musical ring of a flowing spring 
in the bright summertime

4 There is no heart like the heart of Jesus,
Fill'd with a tender love;
No throb of woe that our hearts can know,
But He feeds it above.
