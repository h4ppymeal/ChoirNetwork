Oh, do not let thy Lord depart,
And close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden not thy heart;
Be saved, O tonight.

    O why not tonight? O why not to-night?
    Wilt thou ne saved?
    Then why not tonight?

Tomorrow’s sun may never rise
To bless thy long-deluded sight;
This is the time!—oh, then, be wise!
Be saved, O tonight.

Our God in pity lingers still;
Oh, wilt thou thus His love requite?
Renounce at length thy stubborn will,
Be saved, O tonight.

Our blessèd Lord refuses none
Who would to Him their souls unite;
Believe, obey the work is done
Be saved, O tonight.
