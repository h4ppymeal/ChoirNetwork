When first the risen Lord of pow'r
His chosen ones sent forth,
A charge he gave, that solemn hour,
To preach His saving worth.
"Go ye," said He, "to all mankind;
Declare My Word, and ye shall find:
These signs shall surely follow them
Who on My Name believe."

"No demons shall before them stand,
No poison do them harm;
Nor subtle serpent in their hand
Cause pain or dread alarm."
For Satan's kingdom He o'ercame,
To give His people right to claim:
These signs shall surely follow them 
Who on My name believe.

"They shall with other tongues declare
The wonders of their God;
The sick beneath their hands, by prayer,
Shall rise, to prove My Word,"
So let it be! Firm as His Throne
Stands this clear promise to His own:
These signs shall surely follow them
Who on My Name believe.

Crowned with the flame of Pentecost,
A faithful, fearless band
Proclaimed His Name: a ransomed host
Arose from every land.
The Lord worked with them from on High,
His proven Word could none deny:
These signs shall surely follow them
Who on My name believe.

No word of Thine is void of power;
Now promise, Lord, is vain.
Be this a Pentecostal hour
Confirm Thy Word again!
Nor can'st Thou fail! Thou art the same
As when of old Thou did'st' proclaim:
These signs shall surely follow them
Who on My Name believe.
