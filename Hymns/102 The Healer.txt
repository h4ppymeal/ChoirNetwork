ON THE CROSS CRUCIFIED, IN GREAT SORROW HE DIED; 
THE GIVER OF LIFE WAS HE, 
YET MY LORD WAS DESPISED AND REJECTED OF MEN, 
THIS JESUS OF CALVARY

    HE WAS WOUNDED FOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS, 
    HE WAS BRUISED FOR OUR INIQUITIES, 
    SURELY HE BORE OUR SORROWS,
    AND BY HIS STRIPES WE ARE HEALED

PRICE FOR HEALING WAS PAID,
AS THOSE CRUEL STRIPES WERE MADE,
WITHIN PILATE'S JUDGEMENT HALL, 
NOW HIS SUFF'RING AFFORD PERFECT HEALING FOR ALL, 
THIS WONDERFUL HEALER'S MINE

CAME THE LEPER TO CHRIST, SAYING "SURELY I KNOW, 
THAT THOU, LORD CANST MAKE ME WHOLE", 
WHEN HIS GREAT FAITH WAS SEEN
JESUS SAID, "YES I WILL",
AND TOUCHED HIM AND MADE HIM CLEAN.

HE HAS HEALED MY SICK SOUL, 
MADE ME EV'RY WHIT WHOLE,
AND HE'LL DO THE SAME FOR YOU, 
HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY AND TODAY AND FOR AYE, 
THIS HEALER OF MEN TODAY.
