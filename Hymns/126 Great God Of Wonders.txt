Great God of wonders!
All Thy ways Are matchless,
Godlike and divine;
But the fair glories of Thy grace
More Godlike and unrivalled shine.

    Who is a pardoning God like Thee?
    or Who has grace so rich and free?

In wonder lost, in trembling joy,
We take the pardon of our God:
Pardon for crimes of deepest dye,
A pardon bought with Jesus' blood.

Pardon - from an offended God!
Pardon - for sins of deepest dye!
Pardon - bestowed throughh Jesus' blood!
Pardon - that brings the rebel nigh!

O may this strange,
this matchless grace,
This Godlike miracle of love,
Fill the wide earth with grateful praise,
And all the angelic chorus above!
