King of my life I crown thee now
Thine shall the glory be;
Lest I forget thy thorn-crowned brow,
Lead me to Calvary.

    Lest I forget Gethsemane,
    Lest I forget thine agony,
    Lest I forget thy love for me,
    Lead me to Calvary.
    
Show me the tomb where thou wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept;
Angels in robes of light arrayed
Guarded thee whilst thou slept.

Let me like Mary, thru the gloom,
Come with a gift to thee;
Show to me now the empty tomb 
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear
Daily my cross for thee;
Even thy cup of grief to share
Thou hast borne all for me.
