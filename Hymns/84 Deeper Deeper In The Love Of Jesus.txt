Deeper, deeper, in the love of Jesus,
Daily let me go;
Higher, higher in the school of wisdom,
More of grace to know.

    O deep...er yet, I pray,...
    And high...er everyday...
    And wis...er, blessed Lord,
    In Thy precious, holy word.

Deeper, deeper! blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still,
Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus
And His perfect will.

Deeper, deeper! though it cost hard trials,
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the holy love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.

Deeper, higher everyday in Jesus,
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conqu'ror, and in His own image
Perfected at last.
