Listen to the Master’s pleading,
There is urgent work for all;
Heed the Spirit’s interceding,
Give this answer to the call

    I am ready for the service for Thee, dear Lord,
    Here am I, send me,
    I am willing to be what you’d have me be,
    I will go where you want me to go,
    I am ready for service for Thee, dear Lord,
    Here am I, send me
    Tho’ the pathway seems dark, for Thee I’ll do or die,
    I am ready for service, Lord.

There’s a voice to you now calling,
Will you heed the earnest word?
On the ear ‘tis gently falling,
Give this answer to your Lord

Many souls in sin are dying;
Haste to help them while you may,
For the time is swiftly flying,
Will you now to Jesus say?
