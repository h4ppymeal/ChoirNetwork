There's a blessed land that we call Canaan,
Land of promise, land of victory,
Where the Spirit's given without measure,
Where the soul from self has been set free.

    It is wonderful to live in Canaan,
    Where the milk and honey flow.
    Where the land is bearing in abundance
    And the grapes of Eschol grow.
    It is wonderful to live in Canaan,
    Where the milk and honey flow.
    Won't you join that band,
    Where the live is grand,
    In that blessed Canaan land?

In the land of Canaan there is blessing,
All HIs fullness as He takes control.
Blessed fullness of the Holy Spirit;
O what glory He brings to the soul! 

Have you crossed the Jordan into Canaan,
Have you left the wilderness behind
And received the Spirit in His fullness?
If you haven't then make up your mind.
