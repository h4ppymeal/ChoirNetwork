There’s a peace in my heart
That the world never gave,
A peace it cannot take away;
Though the trials of life
May surround like a cloud,
I’ve a peace that has come here to stay!

    Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine;
    Constantly abiding, rapture divine;
    He never leaves me lonely,
    Whispers, O so kind:
    I will never leave thee, Jesus is mine.

All the world seemed to sing
Of a Savior and king,
When peace sweetly came to my heart;
Troubles all fled away
And my night turned to day,
Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!

This treasure I have
In a temple of clay,
While here on His footstool I roam;
But He’s coming to take
Me some glorious day,
Over there to my heavenly home!
