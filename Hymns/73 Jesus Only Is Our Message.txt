Jesus only is our Message,
Jesus all our theme shall be;
We will lift up Jesus ever
Jesus Only will we see.

    Jesus only, Jesus ever,
    Jesus all in all we sing;
    Saviour, Sanctifier, Healer,
    Baptizer and coming King.

Jesus only is our Saviour,
All our guilt He bore away;
All our righteousness He gives us,
All our strength from day to day.

Jesus is our Sanctifier,
Cleansing us from self and sin;
And with all His Spirit's fulness,
Filling all our hearts within.

Jesus only is our Healer,
All our sicknesses He bare;
And His risen life and fulness,
All His members still may share.

Jesus only is our Power,
His the gift of Pentecost;
Jesus, breathe Thy power upon us,
Fill us with the Holy Ghost.

And for Jesus we are waiting,
Listening for the trumpet's sound;
Then it will be us and Jesus,
Living ever with our God.
