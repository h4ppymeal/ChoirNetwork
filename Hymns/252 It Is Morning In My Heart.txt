All the darkness of the night has passed away,
It is morning in my heart;
I am living in the sunlight of the day,
It is morning in my heart.

    It is morning, it is morning in my heart;
    Jesus made the gloomy shadows all depart.
    Songs of gladness now I sing,
    For since Jesus is my King
    It is morning, it is morning in my heart.

I can the songbirds their refain, 
It is morning in my heart;
And i know that life for me begins
again, It is morning in my heart

Christ has made the world a paradise to me,
It is morning in my heart;
Every duty in the light of love I see,
It is morning in my heart.

Joy has come to dwell with me forever 
it is morning in my heart; 
i shall sing when it reach the other shore,
It is morning in my heart.
