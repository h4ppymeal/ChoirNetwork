Christ, our mighty Captain, leads against the foe;
We will never falter when He bids us go;
Tho' His righteous purpose we may never know,
Yet we'll follow all the way.

    Forward! forward! 'tis the Lord's command.
    Forward! forward to the promised land;
    Forward! forward! let the chorus ring;
    We are sure to win with Christ our King!

Satan's fearful onslaught cannot make us yield
while we trust in Christ our Buckler and our shield
pressing ever on the Spirit's sword we weild,
And follow all the way

Let our glorious banner ever be unfurled;
From its mighty stronghold evil shall be hurled;
Christ, our mighty Captain, overcomes the world,
And we follow all the way. 

Fierce the battle rages, but 'twill not be long,
Then triumphant shall we join the blessed throng,
Joyfully uniting in the victor's song,
If we follow all the way.
