All that draw me I have left behind
Here in Canaan better joys I find;
Peace abiding, blessings unconfined,
For I'm living in Canaan now.

    I am living in Canaan now,
    Where the showers of blessing abound
    Where the riches of grace in plenty are found,
    I am living in Canaan now.

Safe abiding I will never fear,
For my Saviour ever will be near;
When I call Him He will always hear,
For I'm living in Canaan now.

I am drinking from a ceaseless well,
Here in Canaan where I love to dwell,
So to others I am glad to tell,
That I'm living in Canaan now.

Praises ever I am glad to bring
Unto Jesus, my Redeemer, King;
For His mercies I will shout and sing,
For I'm living in Canaan now.
