There came from the skies in the days long ago,
The Lord with a message of love;
The world knew Him not; He was treated with scorn—
This wonderful gift from above.

    They crown’d Him with thorns,
    He was beaten with stripes,
    He was smitten and nailed to the tree;
    But the pain in His heart was the hardest to bear,
    The heart that was broken for me.

He came to His own—to the ones that He lov’d—
The sheep that had wander’d astray;
They heard not His voice; but the friend of mankind
Was hated and driven away.

The birds have their nest, and the foxes have holes,
But He had no place for His head;
A pallet of stone on the cold mountainside,
Was all that He had for His bed.

I cannot reject such a Saviour as He;
Dishonor and wound Him again;
I'll go to His feet and repent of my sin,
Be willing to suffer the pain.

I'll take up my cross, I will walk by His side,
For the pathway of duty I see;
I will follow my Lord and abide in His heart,
The heart that was broken for me.
