The things my God doth hate,
That I no more may do,
Thy creature, Lord, again create,
And all my soul renew;

My soul shall then, like thine,
Abhor the thing unclean,
And sanctify'd thy love divine,
For ever cease from sin.

That blessed law of thine,
Jesu, to me impart;
Thy spirit's law of life divine,
Oh write it in my heart!

Implant it deep within,
Whence it may ne'er remove,
The law of liberty from sin,
The perfect law of love.

Thy nature be my law,
Thy spotless sanctity,
And sweetly ev'ry moment draw
My happy soul to thee;

Soul of my soul remain,
Who didst for all fulfil,
In me, O Lord fulfil again
Thy heav'nly father's will.
