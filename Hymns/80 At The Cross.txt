Alas! and did my Savior bleed, 
and did my Sovereign die!
Would he devote that sacred head 
for sinners such as I? 

    At the cross, at the cross where i first saw the light
    and the burden of my heart rolled away
    it was there by faith ireciived my sight
    and now i am happy all the day!

Was it for crimes that I have done, 
he groaned upon the tree? 
Amazing pity! Grace unknown! 
And love beyond degree! 

Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
and shut its glories in, 
when God, the mighty maker, died 
for his own creature's sin. 

Thus might I hide my blushing face 
while his dear cross appears; 
dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
and melt mine eyes to tears. 

But drops of tears can ne'er repay 
the debt of love I owe. 
Here, Lord, I give myself away; 
'tis all that I can do.
